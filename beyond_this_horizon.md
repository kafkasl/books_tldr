No news, he thought, makes a happy country but a dull breakfast.

"Fine. He has put into circulation an amount of money exactly equal to his costs." "Say that again." "Eh? It's a simple identity. The money he has had to spend, put into circulation, is his costs." "Oh...but how about his profit?" "His profit is part of his cost. You don't expect him to work for nothing." "But profits aren't costs. They're...they're profits." Hamilton felt a little baffled. "Have it your own way. Costs-what you rail 'costs' -- plus profit must equal price. Costs and profits are available as purchasing power to buy the product at a price exactly equal to them. That's how purchasing power comes into existence." "But...but he doesn't buy from himself." "He's a consumer, too. He uses his profits to pay for his own and other producers' products." "But he owns his own products." "Now you've got me mixed up. Forget about him buying his own products. Suppose he buys what he needs for himself from other business men. It comes out the same in the long run. Let's get on. Production puts into circulation the amount of money-exactly-needed to buy the product. But some of that money put into circulation is saved and invested in new production. There it is a cost charge against the new production, leaving a net shortage in necessary purchasing power. The government makes up that shortage by issuing new money." "That's the point that bothers me," said Smith. "It's all right for the government to issue money, but it ought to be backed by something-gold, or government bonds." "Why, in the Name of the Egg, should a symbol represent anything but the thing it is supposed to accomplish?" "But you talk as if money was simply an abstract symbol." "What else is it?" Smith did not answer at once. They had reached an impasse of different concepts, totally different orientations. When he did speak it was to another point. "But the government simply gives away all this new money. That's rank charity. It's demoralizing. A man should work for what he gets. But forgetting that aspect for a moment, you can't run a government that way. A government is just like a business. It can't be all outgo and no income." "Why can't it?' There's no parallel between a government and a business. They are for entirely different purposes." "But it's not sound. It leads to bankruptcy. Read Adam Smith." "I don't know this Adam Smith. Relative of yours?" "No, he's a -- Oh, Lord!" "Crave pardon?" "It's no use," Smith said. "We don't speak the same lingo." "I am afraid that is the trouble, really. I think perhaps you should go to see a corrective semantician."

His morals were strictly pragmatic, and conformed to accepted code as closely as they did only through a shrewd and imaginative self-interest.
