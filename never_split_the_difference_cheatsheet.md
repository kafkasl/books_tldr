Bad signs
- You're right
- I'll try (I plan to fail)

Say no 4 times
1. How am I supposed to do that?
2. Your offer is very generous, I’m sorry, that just doesn’t work for me
3. I’m sorry but I’m afraid I just can’t do that.
4. "No" delivered with a downward inflection and a tone of regard


Tone of voice != message? => Use labels:
* Customer: "Yes . . ."
* You: "I heard you say, ‘Yes,’ but it seemed like there was hesitation in your voice."
* Customer: "Oh, it’s nothing really."
* You: "No, this is important, let’s make sure we get this right."
* Customer: "Thanks, I appreciate it."

Hey Kevin,

talking to the CEO he pointed out the offer we agreed is lower than the original propose. I told him that the discount still makes sense anyway because if you like the platform you're probably interested in either upgrading the accounts or the paid features. Is that correct? os would you be open to make a press release about this? something along those lines would definitely help me justify the discount.

In any case, I'm happy we're reaching and agreement and I'm sending the quote we discussed. Let me know if you need something else.

Best regards,




 it's better to have more people trying the platform and you could always work around by sharing the one account.

I ran our conversation with the CEO and he told me that the offer was for 2 accounts because essentially having 2 accounts at 8k with 25 samples each is less than the original price we discussed. 

He's mainly concerned that if you have 2 accounts already you will not have any incentive to upgrade them, while if you have 1 with 50, you'll probably want to get a second one.
