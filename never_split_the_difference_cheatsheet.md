Calibrated questions
- What is the biggest challenge you face?
- What about this is important to you?
- How can I help to make this better for us?
- How would you like me to proceed?
- What is it that brought us into this situation?
- How can we solve this problem?
- What’s the objective? / What are we trying to accomplish here?
- How am I supposed to do that?


Bad signs
- You're right
- I'll try (I plan to fail)

Say no 4 times
1. How am I supposed to do that?
2. Your offer is very generous, I’m sorry, that just doesn’t work for me
3. I’m sorry but I’m afraid I just can’t do that.
4. "No" delivered with a downward inflection and a tone of regard


Tone of voice != message? => Use labels:
* Customer: "Yes . . ."
* You: "I heard you say, ‘Yes,’ but it seemed like there was hesitation in your voice."
* Customer: "Oh, it’s nothing really."
* You: "No, this is important, let’s make sure we get this right."
* Customer: "Thanks, I appreciate it."
