The first vector of deterioration is cognitive decline.

The third and final category of deterioration, I believe, has to do with emotional health.

Reducing the amount of nutrients available to a cell seems to trigger a group of innate pathways that enhance the cell’s stress resistance and metabolic efficiency—all of them related, in some way, to mTOR.

With regard to ALT liver values, the American College of Gastroenterology recently revised its guidelines to recommend clinical evaluation for liver disease in men with ALT above 33 and women with ALT above 25—significantly below the current “normal” ranges. Even that may not be low enough: a 2002 study that excluded people who already had fatty liver suggested upper limits of 30 for men, and 19 for women.

One of the liver’s many important jobs is to convert this stored glycogen back to glucose and then to release it as needed to maintain blood glucose levels at a steady state, known as glucose homeostasis. This is an incredibly delicate task: an average adult male will have about five grams of glucose circulating in his bloodstream at any given time, or about a teaspoon. That teaspoon won’t last more than a few minutes, as glucose is taken up by the muscles and especially the brain, so the liver has to continually feed in more, titrating it precisely to maintain a more or less constant level.

We have a far greater capacity, almost unlimited, for storing energy as fat—the second possible destination for the calories in that doughnut. Even a relatively lean adult may carry ten kilograms of fat in their body, representing a whopping ninety thousand calories of stored energy.

1537
Wed Aug 9 17:10:18 2023

That decision—where to put the energy from the doughnut—is made via hormones, chief among them insulin, which is secreted by the pancreas when the body senses the presence of glucose, the final breakdown product of most carbohydrates (such as those in the doughnut). Insulin helps shuttle the glucose to where it’s needed, while maintaining glucose homeostasis.

Think of fat as acting like a kind of metabolic buffer zone, absorbing excess energy and storing it safely until it is needed.

As more calories flood into your subcutaneous fat tissue, it eventually reaches capacity and the surplus begins spilling over into other areas of your body: into your blood, as excess triglycerides; into your liver, contributing to NAFLD; into your muscle tissue, contributing directly to insulin resistance in the muscle (as we’ll see); and even around your heart and your pancreas (figure 4).

Wed Aug 9 17:31:58 2023

imagine the cell as a balloon being blown up with air. Eventually, the balloon expands to the point where it gets more difficult to force more air inside. You have to blow harder and harder. This is where insulin comes in, to help facilitate the process of blowing air into the balloon. The pancreas begins to secrete even more insulin, to try to remove excess glucose from the bloodstream and cram it into cells. For the time being it works, and blood glucose levels remain normal, but eventually you reach a limit where the “balloon” (cells) cannot accept any more “air” (glucose).

1601
Wed Aug 9 17:32:28 2023

you have high insulin levels and high blood glucose, and your cells are shutting the gates to glucose entry. If things continue in this way, then the pancreas becomes fatigued and less able to mount an insulin response.

Cortisol is especially potent, with a double-edged effect of depleting subcutaneous fat (which is generally beneficial) and replacing it with more harmful visceral fat. This is one reason why stress levels and sleep, both of which affect cortisol release, are pertinent to metabolism.

when we metabolize fructose in large quantities, a different enzyme takes over, and this enzyme does not put the brakes on ATP “spending.” Instead, energy (ATP) levels inside the cell drop rapidly and dramatically. This rapid drop in energy levels makes the cell think that we are still hungry. The mechanisms are a bit complicated, but the bottom line is that even though it is rich in energy, fructose basically tricks our metabolism into thinking that we are depleting energy—and need to take in still more food and store more energy as fat.[*5]

In my patients, I monitor several biomarkers related to metabolism, keeping a watchful eye for things like elevated uric acid, elevated homocysteine, chronic inflammation, and even mildly elevated ALT liver enzymes. Lipoproteins, which we will discuss in detail in the next chapter, are also important, especially triglycerides; I watch the ratio of triglycerides to HDL cholesterol (it should be less than 2:1 or better yet, less than 1:1), as well as levels of VLDL, a lipoprotein that carries triglycerides—all of which may show up many years before a patient would meet the textbook definition of metabolic syndrome.

I had a calcium “score” of 6. That sounds low, and in absolute terms it was; someone with severe disease could return a score well over 1,000. But for someone age thirty-six, it should have been zero. My score of 6 meant that I had more calcium in my coronary arteries than 75 to 90 percent of people my age.

Cholesterol is essential to life. It is required to produce some of the most important structures in the body, including cell membranes; hormones such as testosterone, progesterone, estrogen, and cortisol; and bile acids, which are necessary for digesting food. All cells can synthesize their own cholesterol, but some 20 percent of our body’s (large) supply is found in the liver, which acts as a sort of cholesterol repository, shipping it out to cells that need it and receiving it back via the circulation. Because cholesterol belongs to the lipid family (that is, fats), it is not water soluble and thus cannot dissolve in our plasma like glucose or sodium and travel freely through our circulation. So it must be carted around in tiny spherical particles called lipoproteins—the final “L” in LDL and HDL—which act like little cargo submarines. As their name suggests, these lipoproteins are part lipid (inside) and part protein (outside); the protein is essentially the vessel that allows them to travel in our plasma while carrying their water-insoluble cargo of lipids, including cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids, plus vitamins and other proteins that need to be distributed to our distant tissues. The reason they’re called high- and low-density lipoproteins (HDL and LDL, respectively) has to do with the amount of fat relative to protein that each one carries. LDLs carry more lipids, while HDLs carry more protein in relation to fat, and are therefore more dense. Also, these particles (and other lipoproteins) frequently exchange cargo with one another, which is part of what drives me crazy about labeling them “good” and “bad.” When an HDL transfers its “good cholesterol” to an LDL particle, does that cholesterol suddenly become “bad”? The answer is no—because it’s not the cholesterol per se that causes problems but the nature of the particle in which it’s transported. Each lipoprotein particle is enwrapped by one or more large molecules, called apolipoproteins, that provide structure, stability, and, most importantly solubility to the particle. HDL particles are wrapped in a type of molecule called apolipoprotein A (or apoA), while LDL is encased in apolipoprotein B (or apoB). This distinction may seem trivial, but it goes to the very root cause of atherosclerotic disease: every single lipoprotein that contributes to atherosclerosis—not only LDL but several others[*1]—carries this apoB protein signature.

endothelium, a delicate but critical layer of tissue that lines all our arteries and veins, as well as certain other tissues, such as the kidneys. Composed of just a single layer of cells, the endothelium acts as a semipermeable barrier between the vessel lumen (i.e., the street, where the blood flows) and the arterial wall proper, controlling the passage of materials and nutrients and white blood cells into and out of the bloodstream. It also helps maintain our electrolyte and fluid balance; endothelial problems can lead to edema and swelling. Another very important job it does is to dilate and contract to allow increased or decreased blood flow, a process modulated by nitric oxide. Last, the endothelium regulates blood-clotting mechanisms,

1933
Thu Aug 10 12:26:29 2023

some of these cholesterol-bearing lipoprotein particles will penetrate the barrier, into an area called the subendothelial space—

1934
Thu Aug 10 12:27:45 2023

HDL particles generally do: particles tagged with apoA (HDL) can cross the endothelial barrier easily in both directions, in and out. LDL particles and other particles with the apoB protein are far more prone to getting stuck inside. This is what actually makes HDL particles potentially “good” and LDL particles potentially “bad”—not the cholesterol, but the particles that carry it.

LDL particles and other particles with the apoB protein are far more prone to getting stuck inside. This is what actually makes HDL particles potentially “good” and LDL particles potentially “bad”—not the cholesterol, but the particles that carry it. The trouble starts when LDL particles stick in the arterial wall and subsequently become oxidized, meaning the cholesterol (and phospholipid) molecules they contain come into contact with a highly reactive molecule known as a reactive oxygen species, or ROS, the cause of oxidative stress. It’s the oxidation of the lipids on the LDL that kicks off the entire atherosclerotic cascade.

the key factor here is actually exposure to apoB-tagged particles, over time.

1951
Thu Aug 10 12:31:53 2023

to gauge the true extent of your risk, we have to know how many of these apoB particles are circulating in your bloodstream. That number is much more relevant than the total quantity of cholesterol that these particles are carrying.

1954
Thu Aug 10 12:32:15 2023

over a long enough time, a certain amount of LDL (and VLDL) will get stuck in that subendothelial space and become oxidized, which then leads to it sticking together in clumps or aggregates.

1955
Thu Aug 10 12:32:46 2023

the endothelium dials up the biochemical equivalent of 911, summoning specialized immune cells called monocytes to the scene to confront the intruders. Monocytes are large white blood cells that enter the subendothelial space and transform into macrophages, larger and hungrier immune cells that are sometimes compared to Pac-Man. The macrophage, whose name means “big eater,” swallows up the aggregated or oxidized LDL, trying to remove it from the artery wall. But if it consumes too much cholesterol, then it blows up into a foam cell,

1959
Thu Aug 10 12:33:34 2023

When enough foam cells gather together, they form a “fatty streak”—literally a streak of fat that you can see with your naked eye

1961
Thu Aug 10 12:34:02 2023

The fatty streak is a precursor of an atherosclerotic plaque, and if you are reading this and are older than fifteen or so, there is a good chance you already have some of these lurking in your arteries. Yes, I said “fifteen” and not “fifty”—this is a lifelong process and it starts very early.

1973
Thu Aug 10 12:35:38 2023

If an HDL particle arrives at our crime scene, with the foam cells and fatty streaks, it can suck the cholesterol back out of the macrophages in a process called delipidation. It then slips back across the endothelial layer and into the bloodstream, to deliver the excess cholesterol back to the liver and other tissues (including fat cells and hormone-producing glands) for reuse.

the ever-growing number of foam cells begin to sort of ooze together into a mass of lipids,

1994
Thu Aug 10 12:39:47 2023

This is what becomes the core of our atherosclerotic plaque. And this is the point where breaking and entering tilts over into full-scale looting. In an attempt to control the damage, the “smooth muscle” cells in the artery wall then migrate to this toxic waste site and secrete a kind of matrix in an attempt to build a kind of barrier around it, like a scar. This matrix ends up as the fibrous cap on your brand-new arterial plaque.

2007
Thu Aug 10 12:42:03 2023

At a certain point in this process, the plaque may start to become calcified. This is what (finally) shows up on a regular calcium scan. Calcification is merely another way in which the body is trying to repair the damage, by stabilizing the plaque to protect the all-important arteries.

2011
Thu Aug 10 12:43:06 2023

If the plaque does become unstable, eroding or even rupturing, you’ve really got problems. The damaged plaque may ultimately cause the formation of a clot, which can narrow and ultimately block the lumen of the blood vessel—or worse, break free and cause a heart attack or stroke. This is why we worry more about the noncalcified plaques than the calcified ones.

2014

They grow silently and invisibly, gradually occluding the blood vessel until one day the obstruction, due to the plaque itself or a plaque-induced clot, becomes a problem.

no physician would likely have treated me for any of this. My blood panel did not signal any significant risk. My LDL-C tested at 110 to 120 mg/dL, just slightly higher than normal but not a cause for concern, particularly in a younger person. My triglycerides were on the higher side, slightly north of 150 mg/dL, but that did not set off any alarm bells either. I now know that these numbers almost certainly indicated a high concentration of atherogenic apoB particles—but no one bothered to test my apoB number, either.

2041
Thu Aug 10 12:47:06 2023

I have all my patients tested for apoB regularly, and you should ask for the same test the next time you see your doctor. (Don’t be waved off by nonsensical arguments about “cost”: It’s about twenty to thirty dollars.)

Anahad’s calcium score was 125—off the charts for someone so young and otherwise healthy. “Can this be real?” he said. It was. It turned out that the culprit was a little-known but very deadly type of particle called Lp(a) (pronounced “el-pee-little-A”). This hot mess of a lipoprotein is formed when a garden-variety LDL particle is fused with another, rarer type of protein called apolipoprotein(a), or apo(a) for short (not to be confused with apolipoprotein A or apoA, the protein that marks HDL particles). The apo(a) wraps loosely around the LDL particle, with multiple looping amino acid segments called “kringles,” so named because their structure resembles the ring-shaped Danish pastry by that name. The kringles are what make Lp(a) so dangerous: as the LDL particle passes through the bloodstream, they scoop up bits of oxidized lipid molecules and carry them along. As my lipid guru Tom Dayspring points out, this isn’t entirely bad. There is some evidence that Lp(a) may act as a sort of cleansing agent, like a street-sweeping truck that gathers up unpleasant and potentially harmful lipid junk and delivers it to the liver. But because Lp(a) is a member of the apoB particle family, it also has the potential to penetrate the endothelium and get lodged in an artery wall; because of its structure, Lp(a) may be even more likely than a normal LDL particle to get stuck, with its extra cargo of lipids gone bad. Even worse, once in there, it acts partly as a thrombotic or proclotting factor, which helps to speed the formation of arterial plaques. Often, the way Lp(a) announces itself is via a sudden, seemingly premature heart attack.

2076
Thu Aug 10 23:40:38 2023

when a patient comes to me and says their father or grandfather or aunt, or all three, died of “premature” heart disease, elevated Lp(a) is the first thing I look for.

2082
Thu Aug 10 23:42:14 2023

We test every single patient for Lp(a) during their first blood draw. Because elevated Lp(a) is largely genetic, the test need only be done once (and cardiovascular disease guidelines are beginning to advise a once-a-lifetime test for it anyway).

2104
Thu Aug 10 23:49:13 2023

When I look at a patient’s blood panel for the first time, my eyes immediately dart to two numbers: apoB and Lp(a). I look at the other numbers, too, but these two tell me the most when it comes to predicting their risk of ASCVD. ApoB not only tells me the concentration of LDL particles (which, you’ll recall, is more predictive of disease than the concentration of cholesterol found within LDL particles, LDL-C), but it also captures the concentration of VLDL particles, which as members of the apoB family can also contribute to atherosclerosis. Furthermore, even someone whose apoB is low can still have a dangerously elevated Lp(a).

2113
Thu Aug 10 23:48:46 2023

I think you can’t lower apoB and LDL-C too much, provided there are no side effects from treatment. You want it as low as possible.

2133
Thu Aug 10 23:51:52 2023

We must also pay attention to other markers of risk, notably those associated with metabolic health, such as insulin, visceral fat, and homocysteine, an amino acid that in high concentrations[*7] is strongly associated with increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and dementia.

They may have other benefits too, including an apparent anti-inflammatory effect, so while I don’t think statins should be dissolved into the drinking water, as some have suggested, I do think they are very helpful drugs for reducing apoB or LDL concentration in many patients. Not everyone can take statins comfortably; about 5 percent of patients experience deal-breaking side effects, most notably statin-related muscle pain. Also, a smaller but nonzero subset of patients taking statins experience a disruption in glucose homeostasis, which may explain why statins are associated with a small increase in the risk for type 2 diabetes. Another fraction of patients experience an asymptomatic rise in liver enzymes, which is even more common in patients also taking the drug ezetimibe. All these side effects are completely and rapidly reversible when the drug is discontinued. But for those who can tolerate them (i.e., most people), I deploy them early and often.

Brief Overview of Lipid-Lowering Medications While there are seven statins on the market, I tend to start with rosuvastatin (Crestor) and only pivot from that if there is some negative effect from the drug (e.g., a symptom or biomarker). My goal is aggressive: as rationalized by Peter Libby, I want to knock someone’s apoB concentration down to 20 or 30 mg/dL, about where it would be for a child. For people who can’t tolerate statins, I like to use a newer drug, called bempedoic acid (Nexletol), which manipulates a different pathway to accomplish much the same end: inhibiting cholesterol synthesis as a way to force the liver to increase LDLR and therefore LDL clearance. But where statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis throughout the body, and most notably in the muscles, bempedoic acid does so only in the liver. Therefore, it does not cause the side effects associated with statins, especially muscle soreness. The main issue with this drug is cost. Another drug called ezetimibe (Zetia) blocks absorption of cholesterol in the GI tract.[*10] That in turn depletes the amount of cholesterol in the liver, leading once again to increased LDLR expression and greater clearance of apoB particles, which is what we want. Ezetimibe pairs very well with statins because statins, which block cholesterol synthesis, tend to cause the body to reflexively increase cholesterol reabsorption in the gut—exactly the thing that ezetimibe so effectively prevents. LDL receptors can be upregulated by a class of drugs that we mentioned earlier, called PCSK9 inhibitors, which attack a protein called PCSK9 that degrades LDL receptors. This increases the receptors’ half-life, thus improving the liver’s ability to clear apoB. As a monotherapy they have about the same apoB- or LDL-C-lowering potency as high-dose statins, but their most common use is in addition to statins; the combination of statins plus PCSK9 inhibitors is the most powerful pharmacological tool that we have against apoB. Alas, statins do not reduce Lp(a), but PCSK9 inhibitors do in most patients, typically to the tune of about 30 percent. Triglycerides also contribute to the apoB particle burden, because they are largely transported in VLDLs. Our dietary interventions are aimed at reducing triglycerides, but in cases where nutritional changes are insufficient, and in cases where genetics render dietary interventions useless, fibrates are the drug of choice. Ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (Vascepa), a drug derived from fish oil and consisting of four grams of pharmaceutical-grade eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), also has FDA approval to reduce LDL in patients with elevated triglycerides.

While the CT angiogram costs a bit more, requires IV dye, and exposes the patient to slightly more radiation, I struggle to find credible arguments against its use. Approximately 15 percent of people who have a normal calcium score (0) are still found to have soft plaque or even small calcifications on CT angiograms, and as many as 2 to 3 percent of people with a zero calcium score are found on CT angiogram to have high-risk plaques. For this reason, I almost always prefer my patients to have a CT angiogram over a calcium scan if we opt to look for evidence of disease via imaging studies.

cancer cells had a strangely gluttonous appetite for glucose, devouring it at up to forty times the rate of healthy tissues. But these cancer cells weren’t “respiring” the way normal cells do, consuming oxygen and producing lots of ATP, the energy currency of the cell, via the mitochondria. Rather, they appeared to be using a different pathway that cells normally use to produce energy under anaerobic conditions, meaning without sufficient oxygen, such as when we are sprinting.

Warburg effect

2463
Sun Aug 13 12:41:47 2023

the Warburg effect generates lots of by-products, such as lactate, a substance that is also produced during intense exercise. In fact, turning glucose into lactate creates so many extra molecules that the authors argued that the relatively small amount of energy it produces may actually be the “by-product.” There’s a logic to this seeming madness: when a cell divides, it doesn’t simply split into two smaller cells. The process requires not only the division of the nucleus, and all that stuff we learned in high school biology, but the actual physical materials required to construct a whole new cell. Those don’t just appear out of nowhere. Normal aerobic cellular respiration produces only energy, in the form of ATP, plus water and carbon dioxide, which aren’t much use as building materials (also, we exhale the latter two). The Warburg effect, also known as anaerobic glycolysis, turns the same amount of glucose into a little bit of energy and a whole lot of chemical building blocks—which are then used to build new cells rapidly. Thus, the Warburg effect is how cancer cells fuel their own proliferation.

family of enzymes called PI3-kinases, or PI3K, that play a major role in fueling the Warburg effect by speeding up glucose uptake into the cell. In effect, PI3K helps to open a gate in the cell wall, allowing glucose to flood in to fuel its growth. Cancer cells possess specific mutations that turn up PI3K activity while shutting down the tumor-suppressing protein PTEN,

In my practice, we go further, typically encouraging average-risk individuals to get a colonoscopy by age forty—and even sooner if anything in their history suggests they may be at higher risk. We then repeat the procedure as often as every two to three years, depending on the findings from the previous colonoscopy. If a sessile (flat) polyp is found, for example, we’re inclined to do it sooner than if the endoscopist finds nothing at all. Two or three years might seem like a very short window of time to repeat such an involved procedure, but colon cancer has been documented to appear within the span of as little as six months to two years after a normal colonoscopy.

This is not the only explanation for how the Warburg effect benefits a cancer cell. Another theory is that it helps protect the tumor from immune cells by making the tumor microenvironment less hospitable because of lower pH (i.e., more acidic) caused by the generation of lactic acid and reactive oxygen species.

For those seeking more detailed guidance, this is what I wrote (Attia 2020a) in a blog post on CRC screening a few years ago: “Before you get your first colonoscopy, there are [a] few things you can do that may improve your risk-to-benefit ratio. You should ask what your endoscopist’s adenoma detection rate (ADR) is. The ADR is the proportion of individuals undergoing a colonoscopy who have one or more adenomas (or colon polyps) detected. The benchmarks for ADR are greater than 30% in men and greater than 20% in women. You should also ask your endoscopist how many perforations he or she has caused, specifically, as well as any other serious complications, like major intestinal bleeding episodes (in a routine screening setting). Another question you should ask is what is your endoscopist’s withdrawal time, defined as the amount of time spent viewing as the colonoscope is withdrawn during a colonoscopy. A longer withdrawal time suggests a more thorough inspection. A 6-minute withdrawal time is currently the standard of care.”

Amyloid-beta is a by-product that is created when a normally occurring substance called amyloid precursor protein, or APP, a membrane protein that is found in neuronal synapses, is cleaved into three pieces. Normally, APP is split into two pieces, and everything is fine. But when APP is cut in thirds, one of the resulting fragments then becomes “misfolded,” meaning it loses its normal structure (and thus its function) and becomes chemically stickier, prone to aggregating in clumps.

3009
Mon Aug 14 12:54:04 2023

Lewy body dementia and Parkinson’s disease are associated with the accumulation of a neurotoxic protein called alpha-synuclein, which builds up in aggregates known as Lewy bodies (first observed by a colleague of Alois Alzheimer’s named Friedrich Lewy). The APOE e4 variant not only increases someone’s risk for Alzheimer’s but also significantly raises their risk of Lewy body dementia as well as Parkinson’s disease with dementia, further supporting the notion that these conditions are related on some level.

If we lack new sources of glucose, the brain’s preferred fuel, the liver converts our fat into ketone bodies, as an alternative energy source that can sustain us for a very long time, depending on the extent of our fat stores. (Unlike muscle or liver, the brain itself does not store energy.) When our fat runs out, we will begin to consume our own muscle tissue, then our other organs, and even bone, all in order to keep the brain running at all costs. The brain is the last thing to shut off.

switch to a Mediterranean-style diet, relying on more monounsaturated fats and fewer refined carbohydrates, in addition to regular consumption of fatty fish. There is some evidence that supplementation with the omega-3 fatty acid DHA, found in fish oil, may help maintain brain health, especially in e4/e4 carriers. Higher doses of DHA may be required because of e4-induced metabolic changes and dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier. This is also one area where a ketogenic diet may offer a real functional advantage: when someone is in ketosis, their brain relies on a mix of ketones and glucose for fuel. Studies in Alzheimer’s patients find that while their brains become less able to utilize glucose, their ability to metabolize ketones does not decline. So it may make sense to try to diversify the brain’s fuel source from only glucose to both glucose and ketones.

Broadly, our strategy should be based on the following principles: WHAT’S GOOD FOR THE HEART IS GOOD FOR THE BRAIN. That is, vascular health (meaning low apoB, low inflammation, and low oxidative stress) is crucial to brain health. WHAT’S GOOD FOR THE LIVER (AND PANCREAS) IS GOOD FOR THE BRAIN. Metabolic health is crucial to brain health. TIME IS KEY. We need to think about prevention early, and the more the deck is stacked against you genetically, the harder you need to work and the sooner you need to start. As with cardiovascular disease, we need to play a very long game. OUR MOST POWERFUL TOOL FOR PREVENTING COGNITIVE DECLINE IS EXERCISE. We’ve talked a lot about diet and metabolism, but exercise appears to act in multiple ways (vascular, metabolic) to preserve brain health; we’ll get into more detail in Part III, but exercise—lots of it—is a foundation of our Alzheimer’s-prevention program.

A person who smokes has a 40 percent greater risk of all-cause mortality (that is, risk of dying at any moment) than someone who does not smoke, representing a hazard ratio or (HR) of 1.40. This study found that someone of below-average VO2 max for their age and sex (that is, between the 25th and 50th percentiles) is at double the risk of all-cause mortality compared to someone in the top quartile (75th to 97.6th percentiles). Thus, poor cardiorespiratory fitness carries a greater relative risk of death than smoking.

“cardio,” we are talking about not one thing, but a physiologic continuum, ranging from an easy walk to an all-out sprint. The various levels of intensity all count as cardio but are fueled by multiple different energy systems. For our purposes, we are interested in two particular regions of this continuum: long, steady endurance work, such as jogging or cycling or swimming, where we are training in what physiologists call zone 2, and maximal aerobic efforts, where VO2 max comes into play.

The strength side of the equation seems simpler, at first: if you use your muscles to counter some resistance, in the form of weights or other forces (e.g., gravity, or elastic bands), they will adapt and grow stronger. That’s how muscle works, and it’s really quite wonderful. There are a few specific movements that I consider to be foundational, but here our most important goal is not only to build strength and muscle mass. It’s equally important that we avoid injury in the process.

When we are exercising in zone 2, most of the work is being done by our type 1, or “slow-twitch,” muscle fibers. These are extremely dense with mitochondria and thus well-suited for slow-paced, efficient endurance work. We can go for a long time without feeling fatigued. If we pick up the pace, we begin to recruit more type 2 (“fast-twitch”) muscle fibers, which are less efficient but more forceful. They also generate more lactate in the process, because of the way they create ATP. Lactate itself is not bad; trained athletes are able to recycle it as a type of fuel. The problem is that lactate becomes lactic acid when paired with hydrogen ions, which is what causes that acute burning you feel in your muscles[*1] during a hard effort.

The problem is that lactate becomes lactic acid when paired with hydrogen ions, which is what causes that acute burning you feel in your muscles[*1] during a hard effort. In technical terms, San Millán describes zone 2 as the maximum level of effort that we can maintain without accumulating lactate. We still produce it, but we’re able to match production with clearance. The more efficient our mitochondrial “engine,” the more rapidly we can clear lactate, and the greater effort we can sustain while remaining in zone 2. If we are “feeling the burn” in this type of workout, then we are likely going too hard, creating more lactate than we can eliminate. Because I am a numbers guy and I love biomarkers and feedback, I often test my own lactate while I am working out this way, using a small handheld lactate monitor, to make sure my pacing is correct. The goal is to keep lactate levels constant, ideally between 1.7 and 2.0 millimoles. This is the zone 2 threshold for most people. If I’m working too hard, lactate levels will rise, so I’ll slow down. (It’s sometimes tempting to go too hard in zone 2, because the workout feels relatively “easy” on good days.) I make a point of this because lactate is literally what defines zone 2. It’s all about keeping lactate levels steady in this range, and the effort sustainable. If you don’t happen to have a portable lactate meter on hand, like most people, there are other ways to estimate your zone 2 range that are reasonably accurate. If you know your maximum heart rate—not estimated, but your actual maximum, the highest number you’ve ever seen on a heart rate monitor—your zone 2 will correspond to between approximately 70 and 85 percent of that peak number, depending on your fitness levels.

When we are exercising in zone 2, most of the work is being done by our type 1, or “slow-twitch,” muscle fibers. These are extremely dense with mitochondria and thus well-suited for slow-paced, efficient endurance work. We can go for a long time without feeling fatigued. If we pick up the pace, we begin to recruit more type 2 (“fast-twitch”) muscle fibers, which are less efficient but more forceful. They also generate more lactate in the process, because of the way they create ATP. Lactate itself is not bad; trained athletes are able to recycle it as a type of fuel. The problem is that lactate becomes lactic acid when paired with hydrogen ions, which is what causes that acute burning you feel in your muscles[*1] during a hard effort. In technical terms, San Millán describes zone 2 as the maximum level of effort that we can maintain without accumulating lactate. We still produce it, but we’re able to match production with clearance. The more efficient our mitochondrial “engine,” the more rapidly we can clear lactate, and the greater effort we can sustain while remaining in zone 2. If we are “feeling the burn” in this type of workout, then we are likely going too hard, creating more lactate than we can eliminate. Because I am a numbers guy and I love biomarkers and feedback, I often test my own lactate while I am working out this way, using a small handheld lactate monitor, to make sure my pacing is correct. The goal is to keep lactate levels constant, ideally between 1.7 and 2.0 millimoles. This is the zone 2 threshold for most people. If I’m working too hard, lactate levels will rise, so I’ll slow down. (It’s sometimes tempting to go too hard in zone 2, because the workout feels relatively “easy” on good days.)

Even when we are at rest, our lactate levels tell us much about our metabolic health. People with obesity or other metabolic problems will tend to have much higher resting lactate levels, a clear sign that their mitochondria are not functioning optimally, because they are already working too hard just to maintain baseline energy levels.

A person who exercises frequently in zone 2 is improving their mitochondria with every run, swim, or bike ride. But if you don’t use them, you lose them.

Studies have found that while we are exercising, our overall glucose uptake increases as much as one-hundred-fold compared to when we are at rest. What’s interesting is that this glucose uptake occurs via multiple pathways. There is the usual, insulin-signaled way that we’re familiar with, but exercise also activates other pathways, including one called non-insulin-mediated glucose uptake, or NIMGU, where glucose is transported directly across the cell membrane without insulin being involved at all. This in turn explains why exercise, especially in zone 2, can be so effective in managing both type 1 and type 2 diabetes: It enables the body to essentially bypass insulin resistance in the muscles to draw down blood glucose levels.

one patient with type 1 diabetes, meaning he produces zero insulin, who keeps his glucose in check almost entirely by walking briskly for six to ten miles every day, and sometimes more. As he walks, his muscle cells are vacuuming glucose out of his bloodstream via NIMGU. He still needs to inject himself with insulin, but only a tiny fraction of the amount that he would otherwise require.

zone 2 is that it is very easy to do, even for someone who has been sedentary. For some people, a brisk walk might get them into zone 2; for those in better condition, zone 2 means walking uphill. There are many different ways to do it: you can ride a stationary bicycle at the gym, or walk or jog or run around the track at the local high school, or swim some laps in the pool. The key is to find an activity that fits into your lifestyle, that you enjoy doing, and that enables you to work at a steady pace that meets the zone 2 test: You’re able to talk in full sentences, but just barely.

4011
Mon Aug 21 12:17:55 2023

about three hours per week of zone 2, or four 45-minute sessions, is the minimum required for most people to derive a benefit and make improvements, once you get over the initial hump of trying it for the first time.

4014
Mon Aug 21 12:18:19 2023

Four times a week, I will spend about an hour riding my stationary bike at my zone 2 threshold. One way to track your progression in zone 2 is to measure your output in watts at this level of intensity. (Many stationary bikes can measure your wattage as you ride.) You take your average wattage output for a zone 2 session and divide it by your weight to get your watts per kilogram, which is the number we care about. So if you weigh 60 kilos (about 132 pounds) and can generate 125 watts in zone 2, that works out to a bit more than 2 watts/kg, which is about what one would expect from a reasonably fit person. These are rough benchmarks, but someone who is very fit will be able to produce 3 watts/kg, while professional cyclists put out 4 watts/kg and up. It’s not the number that matters, but how much you are improving over time. (If you’re a runner or a walker, the same principle applies: As you improve, your zone 2 pace will get faster.) Zone 2 can be a bit boring on its own, so I typically use the time to listen to podcasts or audiobooks, or just think about issues that I’m working on—a side benefit of zone 2 is that it also helps with cognition, by increasing cerebral blood flow and by stimulating the production of BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which we touched on earlier. This is another reason why zone 2 is such an important part of our Alzheimer’s disease prevention program.

Maximum Aerobic Output: VO2 Max

Mon Aug 21 23:17:44 2023

At VO2 max, we are using a combination of aerobic and anaerobic pathways to produce energy, but we are at our maximum rate of oxygen consumption. Oxygen consumption is the key.

Mon Aug 21 23:14:32 2023

the VO2 max test is an unpleasant affair that entails riding an exercise bike or running on a treadmill at ever greater intensity, while wearing a mask designed to measure oxygen consumption and CO2 production. The peak amount of oxygen you consume, typically close to the point at which you “fail,” meaning the point where you just can’t keep going, yields your VO2 max.

The tried-and-true formula for these intervals is to go four minutes at the maximum pace you can sustain for this amount of time—not an all-out sprint, but still a very hard effort. Then ride or jog four minutes easy, which should be enough time for your heart rate to come back down to below about one hundred beats per minute. Repeat this four to six times and cool down.[*4]

make sure that you get as close to fully recovered as possible before beginning the next set. If you fail to recover sufficiently between sets, you will not be able to reach your peak effort in the working sets and you’ll consequently miss the desired adaptation. Also, be sure to give yourself enough time to warm up and then cool down from this intense effort.

The standard guidelines only recommend screening in women at age sixty-five or men at age seventy—which is classic Medicine 2.0, waiting until someone may be staring danger in the eye before doing anything. We think it’s important to get a handle on this much earlier, before any problems arise.

bone density diminishes on a parallel trajectory to muscle mass, peaking as early as our late twenties before beginning a slow, steady decline.

4191
Mon Aug 21 23:47:10 2023

When we detect low or rapidly declining BMD in a middle-aged person, we use the following four strategies: Optimize nutrition, focusing on protein and total energy needs (see nutrition chapters). Heavy loading-bearing activity. Strength training, especially with heavy weights, stimulates the growth of bone—more than impact sports such as running (though running is better than swimming/cycling). Bones respond to mechanical tension and estrogen is the key hormone in mediating the mechanical signal (weight bearing) to a chemical one telling the body to lay down more bone. HRT, if indicated. Drugs to increase BMD, if indicated.

you should at least check your BMD every few years. (Particularly if your primary sports are nonweight-bearing, like cycling or swimming.)

Three or four days a week, I’ll spend an hour rucking around my neighborhood, up and down hills, typically climbing and descending several hundred feet over the course of three or four miles. The fifty- to sixty-pound pack on my back makes it quite challenging, so I’m strengthening my legs and my trunk while also getting in a solid cardiovascular session.

Michael Easter in his eye-opening book The Comfort Crisis. His intriguing thesis is that because we have removed all discomfort of any kind from modern life, we have lost touch with the fundamental skills (not to mention the frequent suffering) that once defined what it meant to be human. Carrying stuff over long distances is one of these skills; our ancestors likely had to range far and wide to hunt food for their families and then carry their kills back to camp to feed everyone.

“Carrying shaped our species,” he says. “Our ancestors carried often. It gave them robust functional strength and endurance that was likely very protective. But we’ve engineered carrying out of our lives, just as we have many other forms of discomfort. Rucking is a practical way to add carrying back into our lives.”

4228
Tue Aug 22 12:00:32 2023

One thing I specifically focus on when rucking is the hills. Going uphill gives me a chance to push my VO2 max energy system; first-time ruckers are amazed at how taxing it is to walk up a 15 percent grade with even twenty pounds on your back—and then walk back down. (A good goal is to be able to carry one-quarter to one-third of your body weight once you develop enough strength and stamina.

Tue Aug 22 12:04:34 2023

Fundamentally I structure my training around exercises that improve the following: Grip strength, how hard you can grip with your hands, which involves everything from your hands to your lats (the large muscles on your back). Almost all actions begin with the grip. Attention to both concentric and eccentric loading for all movements, meaning when our muscles are shortening (concentric) and when they are lengthening (eccentric). In other words, we need to be able to lift the weight up and put it back down, slowly and with control. Rucking down hills is a great way to work on eccentric strength, because it forces you to put on the “brakes.” Pulling motions, at all angles from overhead to in front of you, which also requires grip strength (e.g., pull-ups and rows). Hip-hinging movements, such as the deadlift and squat, but also step-ups, hip-thrusters, and countless single-leg variants of exercises that strengthen the legs, glutes, and lower back.

4243
Tue Aug 22 12:05:24 2023

If you can grip strongly, you can open a jar with ease. If you can pull, you can carry groceries and lift heavy objects. If you can do a hip-hinge correctly, you can get up out of a chair with no problem.

classic farmer’s carry, where you walk for a minute or so with a loaded hex bar or a dumbbell or kettlebell in each hand. (Bonus points: Hold the kettlebell up vertically, keeping your wrist perfectly straight and elbow cocked at ninety degrees, as though you were carrying it through a crowded room.) One of the standards we ask of our male patients is that they can carry half their body weight in each hand (so full body weight in total) for at least one minute,

Next is pulling, which is closely related to grip strength.

4293
Tue Aug 22 12:15:39 2023

It is an anchor movement. In the gym, it typically takes the form of rows, where you’re pulling the weight toward your body, or pull-ups.

Tue Aug 22 12:16:38 2023

The final foundational element of strength is hip-hinging, which is what it sounds like: You bend at the hips—not the spine—to harness your body’s largest muscles, the gluteus maximus and the hamstrings.

4317
Mon Aug 21 12:07:03 2023

This is because the hydrogen ion does not allow the actin and myosin filaments in your muscles to relax, causing pain and stiffness in the muscle.

As fun as it might be to drift a car around a corner, that lost energy is ravaging the tires and taking a toll on the suspension. Neither will last long. When this happens in our bodies, this force dissipation (as it’s called) leaks out via the path of least resistance—typically via joints like knees, elbows, and shoulders, and/or the spine, any or all of which will give out at some point. Joint injuries are almost always the result of this kind of energy leak.

Tue Aug 22 12:32:50 2023

Now I was being told that I couldn’t even do a simple squat correctly. Her iPhone video told a sorry tale, as you can see from the “before” photo on the left (see figure 13): As I loaded my hips and sank down, I automatically shifted my entire body to the right. I look like I’m about to topple over. My problem, as these photos make painfully clear, was that I lacked stability. It even hurts to look at it now, because it reminds me of the thousands of atrocious, strain-inducing squats I’d committed in this awkward position. I was not even aware that I was doing this, but I was likely compensating for various injuries and weaknesses that I had accumulated over the years. This is how it works, as I would learn: We try to cheat or work around our existing injuries and limitations and end up creating new problems. This rightward tilt may even explain my back injury when I was only in my twenties; even at that point, I had already been lifting heavy weights for years. Fixing the situation turned out to be a nine-month process, but it ultimately straightened me out, as you can see in the “after” photo on the right. It required retraining not only my body but my brain.

Her iPhone video told a sorry tale, as you can see from the “before” photo on the left (see figure 13): As I loaded my hips and sank down, I automatically shifted my entire body to the right. I look like I’m about to topple over. My problem, as these photos make painfully clear, was that I lacked stability.

The only way many of us can come close to matching a toddler’s form is to lie on our backs, as Michael Stromsness demonstrated with me in one of our early sessions. Then it becomes much easier to raise our knees into a perfect squat position, with the correct degree of curvature throughout the spine from the base of the skull to the tailbone. This tells us that range of motion per se is not what’s stopping most adults from squatting well; it’s that when the average adult is under a load, even as little as their own bodyweight, the job of stabilizing his or her own torso becomes too much.

HYPERINFLATED. This person is an upper-chest breather who tends to pull up into spinal extension for both respiration and stability. Their lumbar spine is in hyperextension, while their pelvis lives in anterior (forward) tilt, meaning their butt sticks out. They are always pulling up into themselves, trying to look like they are in charge. They have a limited sense of grounding in the feet, and limited ability to pronate to absorb shock (the feet turn outward, or supinate). All of the above makes them quite susceptible to lower back pain, as well as tightness in their calves and hips.

4509
Tue Aug 22 23:21:16 2023

Sad Guy COMPRESSED. Everything about them is sort of scrunched down and tight. Their head juts forward, and so do their shoulders, which kind of roll to the front because they are always pulling forward to try and take in more air. Their midback rolls in an overly flexed or hyperkyphotic posture, and they have limited neck and upper limb motion. Sometimes their lower legs externally rotate, and the feet overpronate. Gravity is weighing them down.

Yogini UNCONTROLLED. These folks have extreme passive range of motion (i.e., flexibility)—and extremely limited ability to control it. They can often do a toe touch and put their palms flat on the floor, but because of their lack of control, these people are quite prone to joint injuries.

I was a hyperinflated Mr. Stay Puft, according to Beth: When I inhaled, my ribs would flare out and up, like a rooster thrusting out his chest. This got air into my lungs, but it also pulled my center of mass forward. To balance, my spine would curve into kyphosis, and my butt would stick out (Beth called it “duck butt”). This hyperextended my hamstrings, effectively disconnecting them from the rest of my body, so I was unable to access these muscles. For all those years, before I realized this, I was deadlifting using only my back and glutes, with virtually no help from my powerful hamstrings.

In DNS, you learn to think of the abdomen as a cylinder, surrounded by a wall of muscle, with the diaphragm on top and the pelvic floor below. When the cylinder is inflated, what you’re feeling is called intra-abdominal pressure, or IAP. It’s critical to true core activation and foundational to DNS training. Learning to fully pressurize the cylinder, by creating IAP, is important to safe movement because the cylinder effectively stabilizes the spine. Here’s another quick exercise to help you understand how to create IAP: breathe all the way in, so you feel as if you are inflating the cylinder on all sides and pulling air all the way down into your pelvic floor, the bottom of the cylinder. You’re not actually “breathing” there, in the sense that air is actually entering your pelvis; you’re seeking maximal lung expansion, which in turn sort of pushes your diaphragm down. With every inhale, focus on expanding the cylinder around its whole diameter and not merely raising the belly. If you do this correctly, you will feel the entire circumference of your shorts expand evenly around your waist, even in the back, not just in the front. When you exhale, the diaphragm comes back up, and the ribs should rotate inward again as your waistband contracts. This inhale develops tension, and as you exhale, pushing out air, you keep that muscular tension all around your cylinder wall. This intra-abdominal pressure is the basic foundation for everything that we do in stability training—a deadlift, squats, anything.

With the Sad Guys and Gals, Beth tends to work more on cross-body rotation, having them swing the arms across the body to open up the chest and shoulders. She is cautious about loading the back and shoulders, preferring to begin with body weight exercises and split-leg work, such as a walking lunge with a reach, either across the body or to the ceiling, on each step.

First, Beth tells her students to think of their feet as having four corners, each of which needs to be rooted firmly on the ground at all times, like the legs of a chair. As you stand there, try to feel each “corner” of each foot pressing into the ground: the base of your big toe, the base of your pinky toe, the inside and outside of your heel. This is easy, and revelatory; when was the last time you felt that grounded?

Now try to put just your big toe back on the floor, while keeping your other toes lifted. Trickier than you’d think, right? Now do the opposite: keep four toes on the floor and lift only your big toe. Then lift all five toes, and try to drop them one by one, starting with your big toe. (You get the idea.)[*3] If you can do this at all, it likely takes a concerted mental effort, your brain telling that big toe to drop or rise—which is exactly the point. One of the goals of stability training is to regain mental control, conscious or not, over key muscles and body parts. Because our feet spend so much time crammed into shoes that may or may not fit properly, and likely have a lot of padding in their soles, many of us have lost touch with our feet, or have worked them into unhelpful contortions over time.

Feet are also crucial to balance, another important element of stability. One key test in our movement assessment is to have our patients stand with one foot in front of the other and try to balance. Now close your eyes and see how long you can hold the position. Ten seconds is a respectable time; in fact, the ability to balance on one leg at ages fifty and older has been correlated with future longevity, just like grip strength.

The point of this exercise is not how much extension or flexion you can reach in extreme Cat or Cow but rather how much segmental control you can achieve, going from one extreme to the other. You should learn to feel the position of each vertebra, which in turn helps you better distribute load and force throughout the spine.

Tue Aug 22 23:48:03 2023

Now when I deadlift, this segmental control allows me to maintain a more neutral arc from my thoracic to lumbar spine, spreading the load evenly; before, my spine would have a sharp lordotic bend, meaning I was taking too much force on its hinge points.

simple exercise to help understand the importance of scapular positioning and control, a movement known as Scapular CARs, for controlled articular rotations: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and place a medium to light resistance band under your feet, one handle in each hand (a very light dumbbell also works). Keeping your arms at your sides, raise your shoulder blades, and then squeeze them back and together; this is retraction, which is where we want them to be when under load. Then drop them down your back. Finally, bring them forward to the starting point. We start out moving in squares like this, but the goal is to learn enough control that we can move our scapulae in smooth circles. A large part of what

These moves and drills that I’ve described thus far represent only the very basic elements of stability work.

Hip-Hinging 101: How to Do a Step-Up Rather than try to describe multiple exercises, I think it’s more instructive to provide a deeper explanation of one exercise. I’ve chosen a step-up, simply stepping up onto a box or a chair, for three reasons. First, it’s a hip-hinging movement, one of our core elements of strength training. Second, it’s a single-leg exercise that does not require much axial (spine) loading, even with weights in your hands, which means it’s very safe, even for beginners (you’ll start with just your body weight). Third, it’s one of the best exercises to target the eccentric phase of the movement as well as the concentric phase. I also like it because it demonstrates some of the key stability concepts we have been learning in this chapter. First, find a box or a sturdy chair such that when your foot is on the step your thigh will be parallel to the floor. For most people this is about sixteen to twenty inches, but if that is too difficult start with twelve inches. Place one foot on the box, making sure that the big toe and pinky toe mounds and the entire heel are connected firmly to its surface (I like to do these barefoot). The back foot remains on the floor, roughly twelve inches behind the box, with roughly 40 percent of your weight on the back leg and 60 percent on the front leg. Keep your front hip flexed, spine tall, chest heavy (ribs down), arms relaxed by your sides, and eyes forward. Now, slightly shift your head, ribs, and pelvis forward at the same time as you quietly but fully inhale through your nose, allowing the diaphragm to descend and creating intra-abdominal pressure. You should feel pressure in the center of the front foot, toward the heel, but keep your toes connected to the box. Glide your front femur back slightly, so that you feel a stretch in both the hamstring and the glute max; they should be very slightly loaded. This sensation is the essence of the hip-hinge. You want to lead with your glutes and hamstrings, not pelvis or ribs. All of your power will come from these muscles working together, and not your back. Keep your knee behind your toes, and your pelvis and ribs in alignment, and load your front foot evenly, not favoring either the toes/forefoot or heel. With your front foot, push down on the box with intent and with minimal push-off assistance from the back foot. Lift yourself off the floor, exhaling as you initiate the movement, extend the hip, and stand up straight on top of the box. Your head and ribs should finish directly over the pelvis. Bring your rear leg through to finish beside and a little in front of the working leg. Everything should arrive at the same time, as you complete the exhale (feeling the compression in the ribs). Hold this position for a second or two. On the way down, step the nonworking (now front) foot off the back of the box as your head, ribs, and shoulders shift slightly forward and the hip flexes to (once again) prepare the hamstring and glute to lower your weight. Load the front of the stationary foot, the toes actively flexed into the box. As you lower your body down and back through space, feel the weight shifting from the forefoot into the midfoot, and finally to the heel, in a smooth, coordinated fashion that is controlled by the hamstring (think: slowly rocking backward). Keep the tempo as slow and even as possible; aim for three seconds from step-off to landing (difficult; two seconds is good). As the back foot lowers, your weight continues to shift back until you “land.” Avoid shifting more than 40 percent of your weight to the back foot, to reduce the temptation to use forward momentum to start the next rep. Repeat. Do five to six reps on each side. Start with body weight only, but once you have the movement and sensation down, you can add weights, ideally a dumbbell or kettlebell in each hand. (Bonus points: Now you are training grip strength as well as hip-hinging.) The loaded exercise is essentially the same in terms of sequence and position, with a few caveats: Load is now a function of two things: weight and box height. Box height can be an issue if mobility (flexibility and loading tolerance) is a factor. The weights must hang straight down from the shoulders. The brain will find any way to conserve energy and “cheat,” so avoid the subconscious urge to swing the weights forward or lift the shoulders to initiate the step-up (highly likely if the load is too heavy). The glute and hamstring should be doing all the work. If the eccentric phase (step-down) cannot be controlled, the weight is too heavy. You never want to feel as if you are falling back. Try using less weight, or a shorter (two-second) step-down at first. It is crucial to keep the ribs and head above or slightly ahead of the pelvis as you initiate the step-up. If you lead with the pelvis, you will be bending your back and also putting too much pressure on the knee. You will find more video demonstrations on my website, at www.peterattiamd.com/​outlive/​videos.

clever trick that Michael Rintala showed me: put two tennis balls in an athletic sock about four to six inches apart, and position them just about at the level of my kidneys, or where my thoracic spine meets my lumbar spine. Then, with every breath I try to make sure I expand fully enough to feel the tennis balls on both sides. The idea is that it cues your breathing. When I did this, I could get off a five-hour flight and feel as if I had not been sitting for longer than about five minutes.

What problem are we trying to solve here? What is our goal with Nutrition 3.0? I think it boils down to the simple questions that we posited in chapter 10: Are you undernourished, or overnourished? Are you undermuscled, or adequately muscled? Are you metabolically healthy or not?

Nutrition is relatively simple, actually. It boils down to a few basic rules: don’t eat too many calories, or too few; consume sufficient protein and essential fats; obtain the vitamins and minerals you need; and avoid pathogens like E. coli and toxins like mercury or lead. Beyond that, we know relatively little with complete certainty. Read that sentence again, please.

Case in point: The claim that eating red meats and processed meats “causes” colorectal cancer. According to a very well-publicized 2017 study from the Harvard School of Public Health and the World Health Organization, eating those kinds of meats raises one’s risk of colon cancer by 17 percent (HR = 1.17). That does sound scary—but does it pass the Bradford Hill tests? I don’t think so, because the association is so weak. For comparison’s sake, someone who smokes cigarettes is at more like 1,000 to 2,500 percent (ten to twenty-five times) increased risk of lung cancer, depending on the population being studied. This suggests that there might actually be some sort of causation at work. Yet very few published epidemiological studies show a risk increase of even 50 percent (HR = 1.50) for any given type of food.

Second, and far more damning, is that the raw data on which these conclusions are typically based are shaky at best.

it is so important to evaluate any intervention, nutritional or otherwise, through the lens of efficacy versus effectiveness.

almost all diets rely on at least one of the following three strategies to accomplish this: CALORIC RESTRICTION, or CR: eating less in total, but without attention to what is being eaten or when it’s being eaten DIETARY RESTRICTION, or DR: eating less of some particular element(s) within the diet (e.g., meat, sugar, fats) TIME RESTRICTION, or TR: restricting eating to certain times, up to and including multiday fasting

Mon Aug 28 23:48:13 2023

From the standpoint of pure efficacy, CR or caloric restriction is the winner, hands down. This is how bodybuilders shed weight while holding on to muscle mass, and it also allows the most flexibility with food choices. The catch is that you have to do it perfectly—tracking every single thing you eat, and not succumbing to the urge to cheat or snack—or it doesn’t work. Many people have a hard time sticking with it. DR or dietary restriction is probably the most common strategy employed for reducing energy intake. It is conceptually simple: pick a type of food, and then don’t eat that food. It only works, obviously, if that food is both plentiful and significant enough that eliminating it will create a caloric deficit. Saying you’re going on the “no lettuce” diet is pretty much doomed to fail. And you can still overeat while adhering perfectly to a particular DR, as I found out when I attempted to go vegan. TR or time restriction—also known as intermittent fasting—is the latest trend in ways to cut calories. In some ways I think it’s the easiest. When I was a cyclist, and I was trying to drop that six final pounds from my already very light (for me) frame, this became my jam. I would allow myself only one meal per day, despite doing about three hours per day of training. But this can still backfire if you overeat. I have, much to my amusement, watched patients gain weight on a one-meal-a-day approach by turning their meal into a contest to see who could eat the most pizza and ice cream. But the more significant downside of this approach is that most people who try it end up very protein deficient (we’ll cover protein needs later in this chapter). One not uncommon scenario that we see with TR is that a person loses weight on the scale, but their body composition alters for the worse: they lose lean mass (muscle) while their body fat stays the same or even increases.

The most profound difference between the two studies was also the most fundamental, for a diet study: the food that the monkeys ate. The Wisconsin animals ate an off-the-shelf commercial monkey chow that was “semipurified,” meaning its ingredients were highly processed and rigorously titrated. The NIH monkeys were fed a diet that was similar in its basic macronutrient profile, but their chow was “natural” and less refined, custom formulated from whole ingredients by an in-house primate nutritionist at NIH.

5203
Mon Aug 28 23:57:55 2023

the NIH monkey chow contained about 4 percent sugar, the Wisconsin diet comprised an astonishing 28.5 percent sucrose, by weight. That is a greater proportion of sugar than you’ll find in vanilla Häagen-Dazs ice cream.

5205
Mon Aug 28 23:58:25 2023

more than 40 percent of the Wisconsin control monkeys, the ones not subject to calorie limitations, developed insulin resistance and prediabetes, while just one in seven of the NIH controls became diabetic.

5207
Tue Aug 29 12:00:31 2023

the Wisconsin control monkeys proved far more likely to die from cardiovascular causes and cancer than monkeys from any other group. This could suggest that caloric restriction was eliminating early deaths because of the bad Wisconsin diet more than it was actually slowing aging—

Avoiding diabetes and related metabolic dysfunction—especially by eliminating or reducing junk food—is very important to longevity.

The quality of the food you eat could be as important as the quantity. If you’re eating the SAD, then you should eat much less of it. Conversely, if your diet is high quality to begin with, and you are metabolically healthy, then only a slight degree of caloric restriction—or simply not eating to excess—can still be beneficial.

5234
Tue Aug 29 12:02:55 2023

I’m not convinced that whatever longevity boost long-term, deep caloric restriction may confer is worth some of the trade-offs—including potentially weakened immunity and greater susceptibility to cachexia and sarcopenia (muscle loss), not to mention constant hunger. These unwanted side effects would accelerate some of the negative processes that already go along with aging, suggesting that in older people especially, caloric restriction might do more harm than good.

A ketogenic diet means restricting carbohydrates to such an extent that the body begins metabolizing fat into “ketone bodies” that the muscles and brain can utilize as fuel.

Tue Aug 29 12:10:19 2023

Alcohol serves no nutritional or health purpose but is a purely hedonic pleasure that needs to be managed. It’s especially disruptive for people who are overnourished, for three reasons: it’s an “empty” calorie source that offers zero nutrition value; the oxidation of ethanol delays fat oxidation, which is the exact opposite of what we want if we’re trying to lose fat mass; and drinking alcohol very often leads to mindless eating.

5317
Tue Aug 29 12:11:06 2023

Like fructose, alcohol is preferentially metabolized in the liver, with well-known long-term consequences in those who drink to excess.

Now we have a tool to help us understand our own individual carbohydrate tolerance and how we respond to specific foods. This is called continuous glucose monitoring, or CGM, and it has become a very important part of my armamentarium in recent years.

5385
Tue Aug 29 12:17:35 2023

From these studies, it seems quite clear that we want to lower average blood glucose and reduce the amount of variability from day to day and hour to hour. CGM is a tool that can help us achieve that.

5397
Tue Aug 29 12:18:41 2023

CGM has proved especially useful in patients with APOE e4, where we often see big glucose spikes, even in relatively young people. In these patients, the behavior modification that CGM prompts is an important part of their Alzheimer’s disease prevention strategy.

Also, everyone tends to be more insulin sensitive in the morning than in the evening, so it makes sense to front-load our carb consumption earlier in the day.

5416
Tue Aug 29 12:20:44 2023

your carbohydrate tolerance is heavily influenced by other factors, especially your activity level and sleep.

5421
Tue Aug 29 12:21:18 2023

From years of experience with my own CGM and that of my patients, it still amazes me how much even one night of horrible sleep cripples our ability to dispose of glucose the next day.

5422
Tue Aug 29 12:21:57 2023

CGM is about what happens to a patient’s glucose levels during the night. If she goes to bed at, say, 80 mg/dL, but then her glucose ramps up to 110 for most of the night, that tells me that she is likely dealing with psychological stress. Stress prompts an elevation in cortisol, which in turn stimulates the liver to drip more glucose into circulation. This tells me that we need to address her stress levels and probably also her sleep quality.

5436
Wed Aug 30 23:55:13 2023

We also monitor other variables that are relevant to diet, beginning with weight (obviously) but continuing with body composition, the ratios of lean mass and fat mass, and how they change. We can also look at biomarkers such as lipids, uric acid, insulin, and liver enzymes. All of these taken together start to give us a better way to evaluate our progress than any one in isolation.

5439
Wed Aug 30 23:59:57 2023

Lessons from Continuous Glucose Monitoring In the years that I have used CGM, I have gleaned the following insights—some of which may seem obvious, but the power of confirmation cannot be ignored: Not all carbs are created equal. The more refined the carb (think dinner roll, potato chips), the faster and higher the glucose spike. Less processed carbohydrates and those with more fiber, on the other hand, blunt the glucose impact. I try to eat more than fifty grams of fiber per day. Rice and oatmeal are surprisingly glycemic (meaning they cause a sharp rise in glucose levels), despite not being particularly refined; more surprising is that brown rice is only slightly less glycemic than long-grain white rice. Fructose does not get measured by CGM, but because fructose is almost always consumed in combination with glucose, fructose-heavy foods will still likely cause blood-glucose spikes. Timing, duration, and intensity of exercise matter a lot. In general, aerobic exercise seems most efficacious at removing glucose from circulation, while high-intensity exercise and strength training tend to increase glucose transiently, because the liver is sending more glucose into the circulation to fuel the muscles. Don’t be alarmed by glucose spikes when you are exercising. A good versus bad night of sleep makes a world of difference in terms of glucose control. All things equal, it appears that sleeping just five to six hours (versus eight hours) accounts for about a 10 to 20 mg/dL (that’s a lot!) jump in peak glucose response, and about 5 to 10 mg/dL in overall levels. Stress, presumably, via cortisol and other stress hormones, has a surprising impact on blood glucose, even while one is fasting or restricting carbohydrates. It’s difficult to quantify, but the effect is most visible during sleep or periods long after meals. Nonstarchy veggies such as spinach or broccoli have virtually no impact on blood sugar. Have at them. Foods high in protein and fat (e.g., eggs, beef short ribs) have virtually no effect on blood sugar (assuming the short ribs are not coated in sweet sauce), but large amounts of lean protein (e.g., chicken breast) will elevate glucose slightly. Protein shakes, especially if low in fat, have a more pronounced effect (particularly if they contain sugar, obviously). Stacking the above insights—in both directions, positive or negative—is very powerful. So if you’re stressed out, sleeping poorly, and unable to make time to exercise, be as careful as possible with what you eat. Perhaps the most important insight of them all? Simply tracking my glucose has a positive impact on my eating behavior. I’ve come to appreciate the fact that CGM creates its own Hawthorne effect, a phenomenon where study subjects change their behavior because they are being observed. It makes me think twice when I see the bag of chocolate-covered raisins in the pantry, or anything else that might raise my blood glucose levels.

The first thing you need to know about protein is that the standard recommendations for daily consumption are a joke. Right now the US recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 g/kg of body weight. This may reflect how much protein we need to stay alive, but it is a far cry from what we need to thrive. There is ample evidence showing that we require more than this—and that consuming less leads to worse outcomes. More than one study has found that elderly people consuming that RDA of protein (0.8 g/kg/day) end up losing muscle mass, even in as short a period as two weeks. It’s simply not enough.

a number of mouse studies have suggested that restricting protein can improve mouse lifespan. I am not convinced that these results are applicable to humans, however. Mice and human beings respond very differently to low protein, and numerous studies suggest that low protein in the elderly leads to low muscle mass, yielding greater mortality and worse quality of life. I am more persuaded by this human data than I am by studies in mice, who are simply not the same as us.

5489
Thu Aug 31 12:07:32 2023

How much protein do we actually need? It varies from person to person. In my patients I typically set 1.6 g/kg/day as the minimum, which is twice the RDA.

data suggest that for active people with normal kidney function, one gram per pound of body weight per day (or 2.2 g/kg/day) is a good place to start—nearly triple the minimal recommendation.

if someone weighs 180 pounds, they need to consume a minimum of 130 grams of protein per day, and ideally closer to 180 grams, especially if they are trying to add muscle mass.

5494
Thu Aug 31 12:08:46 2023

the added challenge is that it should not be taken in one sitting but rather spread out over the day to avoid losing amino acids to oxidation (i.e., using them to produce energy when we want them to be available for muscle protein synthesis).

5496
Thu Aug 31 12:10:20 2023

The literature suggests that the ideal way to achieve this is by consuming four servings of protein per day, each at ~0.25 g/lb of body weight. A six-ounce serving of chicken, fish, or meat will provide about 40 to 45 grams (at about 7 grams of actual protein per ounce of meat), so our hypothetical 180-pound person should eat four such servings a day.

Fats have long had a bad rap, on two counts: their high caloric content (9 kcal/g) and their role in raising LDL cholesterol and thus heart disease risk.

5547
Sun Sep 3 16:57:00 2023

fats are both. They are very efficient fuel for oxidation (think: slow-burning logs) and also the building blocks for many of our hormones (in the form of cholesterol) and cell membranes.

5548
Sun Sep 3 16:57:33 2023

Eating the right mix of fats can help maintain metabolic balance, but it is also important for the health of our brain, much of which is composed of fatty acids.

5550
Sun Sep 3 16:58:00 2023

There are (broadly) three types of fats: saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).[*9]

5555
Sun Sep 3 17:12:57 2023

Within PUFA, we make one more important distinction, which is to separate the omega-6 from the omega-3 variants (also a chemical distinction having to do with the position of the first double bond). We can further subdivide omega-3 PUFA into marine (EPA, DHA) and nonmarine sources (ALA). Salmon and other oil-rich seafood provide the former, nuts and flaxseed the latter.

5560
Sun Sep 3 17:14:13 2023

all foods that contain fats typically contain all three categories of fat: PUFA, MUFA, and SFA. Even a ribeye steak contains a lot of monounsaturated fats.

5566
Sun Sep 3 17:17:39 2023

we try to boost MUFA closer to 50–55 percent, while cutting SFA down to 15–20 percent and adjusting total PUFA to fill the gap. We also boost EPA and DHA, those fatty acids that are likely important to brain and cardiovascular health, with marine fat sources and/or supplementation.

5568
Sun Sep 3 17:17:48 2023

We titrate the level of EPA and DHA in our patients’ diets by measuring the amount of each found in the membranes of their red blood cells (RBC), using a specialized but readily available blood test.[*11] Our target depends on a person’s APOE genotype and other risk factors for neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disease, but for most patients the range we look for is between 8 and 12 percent of RBC membrane composed of EPA and DHA.

5572
Sun Sep 3 17:19:09 2023

these changes into practice typically means eating more olive oil and avocados and nuts, cutting back on (but not necessarily eliminating) things like butter and lard, and reducing the omega-6-rich corn, soybean, and sunflower oils—while also looking for ways to increase high-omega-3 marine PUFAs from sources such as salmon and anchovies.[*12]

5611
Sun Sep 3 17:35:57 2023

I use an expanded lipid panel to keep track of how changes in fatty acid consumption may affect my patients’ cholesterol synthesis and reabsorption, and their overall lipid and inflammatory response.

5614
Sun Sep 3 17:36:03 2023

Some people (like me)[*13] can consume saturated fats with near impunity, while others can hardly even look at a slice of bacon without their apoB number jumping to the 90th percentile.

5620
Sun Sep 3 17:37:51 2023

I tell my patients that on the basis of the least bad, least ambiguous data available, MUFAs are probably the fat that should make up most of our dietary fat mix, which means extra virgin olive oil and high-MUFA vegetable oils. After that, it’s kind of a toss-up, and the actual ratio of SFA and PUFA probably comes down to individual factors such as lipid response and measured inflammation.

5623
Sun Sep 3 17:37:37 2023

Finally, unless they are eating a lot of fatty fish, filling their coffers with marine omega-3 PUFA, they almost always need to take EPA and DHA supplements in capsule or oil form.

Sun Sep 3 17:39:15 2023

There is no denying that some good things happen when we are not eating. Insulin drops dramatically because there are no incoming calories to trigger an insulin response. The liver is emptied of fat in fairly short order. Over time, within three days or so, the body enters a state called “starvation ketosis,” where fat stores are mobilized to fulfill the need for energy—yet at the same time, as I often noticed when I was undergoing regular lengthy fasts, hunger virtually disappears.

5634

lack of nutrients accelerates autophagy, the cellular “recycling” process that helps our cells become more resilient, and it activates FOXO, the cellular repair genes that may help centenarians live so long.

5659
Sun Sep 3 17:45:15 2023

a mouse lives for only about two to three years—and will die after just forty-eight hours without food—a sixteen-hour fast for a mouse is akin to a multiday fast for a human. It’s just not a valid comparison.

5661
Sun Sep 3 17:45:54 2023

Human trials of this eating pattern have failed to find much of a benefit. A 2020 clinical trial by Ethan Weiss and colleagues found no weight loss or cardiometabolic benefits in a group of 116 volunteers on a 16/8 eating pattern. Two similar studies also found minimal benefit. One other study did find that shifting the eating window to early in the day, from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., actually did result in lower twenty-four-hour glucose levels, reduced glucose excursions, and lower insulin levels compared to controls. So perhaps an early-day feeding window could be effective, but in my view sixteen hours without food simply isn’t long enough to activate autophagy or inhibit chronic mTOR elevation, or engage any of the other longer-term benefits of fasting that we would want to obtain. Another drawback is that you are virtually guaranteed to miss your protein target with this approach (see “Protein,” above).

If your issues fall more in the domain of lipoproteins and cardiovascular risk, then it makes sense to focus on the fats side of the equation as well, meaning mostly saturated fats, which raise apoB in some people, although this is relatively easy to control pharmacologically.

5751

Excessive carbohydrate intake can also have spillover effects on apoB, in the form of elevated triglycerides.

5795
Sun Sep 3 17:59:02 2023

The differences between types of fats all come down to organic chemistry. Fatty acids are essentially chains of carbon atoms of various lengths. That’s why we refer to some fats as medium-chain fatty acids versus long-chain fatty acids, for example. A saturated fat gets its name from the fact that it is fully “saturated” with hydrogen atoms attached to that carbon chain. A “monounsaturated” fat refers to the fact that the chain is not fully saturated with hydrogens, and in this case, the reason is that there is one (i.e., mono) double bond in the chain of carbons rather than a single bond. With polyunsaturated fats, there is more than one double bond (confused yet?). Double bonds cause bends in the carbon chain and make the fatty acid more prone to oxidation. Saturated fats are more stable and do not easily react with other molecules. Since saturated fats are linear and can be densely packed together, they can be more solid at room temperature. Because unsaturated fats have kinks in their structure, they are more likely to be liquid at room temperature.

This association between sleep and metabolic health seems puzzling at first, but I think the missing link here is stress. Higher stress levels can make us sleep poorly, as we all know, but poor sleep also makes us more stressed. It’s a feedback loop. Both poor sleep and high stress activate the sympathetic nervous system, which—despite its name—is the opposite of calming. It is part of our fight-or-flight response, prompting the release of hormones called glucocorticoids, including the stress hormone cortisol. Cortisol raises blood pressure; it also causes glucose to be released from the liver, while inhibiting the uptake and utilization of glucose in the muscle and fat tissues, perhaps in order to prioritize glucose delivery to the brain. In the body, this manifests as elevated glucose due to stress-induced insulin resistance.

limiting subjects’ sleep to four or five hours a night suppresses their levels of leptin, the hormone that signals to us that we are fed, while increasing levels of ghrelin, the “hunger” hormone.

When we are deprived of REM, studies have found, we have a more difficult time reading others’ facial expressions. REM-deprived study subjects interpreted even friendly or neutral expressions as menacing. This is not trivial: our ability to function as social animals[*3] depends on our ability to understand and navigate the feelings of others.

REM sleep seems to protect our emotional equilibrium, while helping us process memories and information.

Deep sleep, on the other hand, seems to be essential to the very health of our brain as an organ.

Successfully treating sleep disturbance may delay the age of onset into MCI—by about eleven years, according to one study—and may improve cognitive function in patients already diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.

research points to the forties and sixties as the decades of life when deep sleep is especially important for the prevention of Alzheimer’s disease. People who have slept less during those decades seem to be at higher risk of developing dementia later on.

it also improves sleep architecture, which is exactly what trazodone does—and most other sleep meds do not.[*4] We typically use it at much lower doses, from one hundred milligrams down to fifty milligrams or even less; the optimal dosing depends on the individual, but the goal is to find the amount that improves their sleep quality without next-day grogginess. (We have also had good results with the supplement ashwagandha.)

Epworth Sleepiness Scale, which asks users to rate how likely they are to fall asleep in certain situations, on a scale of 0 (not likely) to 3 (very likely): Sitting and reading Watching TV Sitting in a meeting or other public place As a passenger in a car for an hour Lying down to rest in the afternoon Sitting and talking to someone Sitting after lunch (without alcohol) In a car, stopped for a few minutes in traffic A total score of 10 or more indicates excessive sleepiness and likely points to an issue with sleep quality.[*6]

people think of caffeine as a stimulant that somehow gives us energy, but actually it functions more as a sleep blocker. It works by inhibiting the receptor for a chemical called adenosine, which normally helps us go to sleep every night. Over the course of the day, adenosine builds up in our brain, creating what scientists call “sleep pressure,” or the drive to sleep. We may be tired and needing sleep, but if we ingest caffeine it effectively takes the phone off the hook, so our brain never gets the message.

How to Improve Your Sleep

Don’t drink any alcohol, period—and if you absolutely, positively must, limit yourself to one drink before about 6 p.m. Alcohol probably impairs sleep quality more than any other factor we can control. Don’t confuse the drowsiness it produces with quality sleep. Don’t eat anything less than three hours before bedtime—and ideally longer. It’s best to go to bed with just a little bit of hunger (although being ravenous can be distracting.) Abstain from stimulating electronics, beginning two hours before bed. Try to avoid anything involving a screen if you’re having trouble falling asleep. If you must, use a setting that reduces the blue light from your screen. For at least one hour before bed, if not more, avoid doing anything that is anxiety-producing or stimulating, such as reading work email or, God help you, checking social media. These get the ruminative, worry-prone areas of our brain humming, which is not what you want. For folks who have access, spend time in a sauna or hot tub prior to bed. Once you get into the cool bed, your lowering body temperature will signal to your brain that it’s time to sleep. (A hot bath or shower works too.) The room should be cool, ideally in the midsixties. The bed should be cool too. Use a “cool” mattress or one of the many bed-cooling devices out there. These are also great tools for couples who prefer different temperatures at night, since both sides of the mattress can be controlled individually. Darken the room completely. Make it dark enough that you can’t see your hand in front of your face with your eyes open, if possible. If that is not achievable, use an eye shade. I use a silky one called Alaska Bear that costs about $8 and works better than the fancier versions I’ve tried. Give yourself enough time to sleep—what sleep scientists call a sleep opportunity. This means going to bed at least eight hours before you need to wake up, preferably nine. If you don’t even give yourself a chance to get adequate sleep, then the rest of this chapter is moot. Fix your wake-up time—and don’t deviate from it, even on weekends. If you need flexibility, you can vary your bedtime, but make it a priority to budget for at least eight hours in bed each night. Don’t obsess over your sleep, especially if you’re having problems. If you need an alarm clock, make sure it’s turned away from you so you can’t see the numbers. Clock-watching makes it harder to fall asleep. And if you find yourself worrying about poor sleep scores, give yourself a break from your sleep tracker.

Trauma generally falls into five categories: (1) abuse (physical or sexual, but also emotional or spiritual); (2) neglect; (3) abandonment; (4) enmeshment (the blurring of boundaries between adults and children); and (5) witnessing tragic events. Most of the things that wound children fit into these five categories.

His main thesis is that with women, depression is generally overt, or obvious, but men are socialized to conceal their depression, channeling it inward or into other emotions, such as anger, without ever wanting to discuss it.

One of the first things I wrote in my journal, after an early discussion with Terry, still resonates today: “90% of male rage is helplessness masquerading as frustration.”

“Family pathology rolls from generation to generation like a fire in the woods taking down everything in its path until one person, in one generation, has the courage to turn and face the flames. That person brings peace to his ancestors and spares the children that follow.”
