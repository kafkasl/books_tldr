# How to be an epicurean

Author: Catherine Wilson

## Back to basics

p27

To return to the theme of atomic reality, the realisation that everything is fragile and tends with time to get broken up points us in two directions. First, we should not be surprised that our wine glasses break, our houses crumble, stock market runs come to an end and our relationships go awry.


The Epicurean expects the future to be predictable and stable where experience and science have shown it to be so, but she is always prepared for surprises.

## The material mind

p52

...an emerging trend is to propose that evolution has tapped into quantum mechanics. If organisms can tap into the laws of hydrodynamics to swim and fly efficiently, and the laws of action and reaction to push off from the earth in locomotion; if they can use photons to see, and to organise their circadian rhythms, why should they not be able to tap into quantum mechanics to master som of the challenges of life?
We tend to think of consciousness as all or nothing. We suppose that either a conscious organism experiences the world just as I do or that it is just an insensate machine. But this must be wrong. There must be forms and degrees of consciousness that are only somewhat or hardly at all like mine, as well as forms that are very like mine. If the nervous system first evolved to co-ordinate movement, we can imagine that a side effect of having just a little bit of conscious awareness - perhaps for pain or scent - could give an early organism an advantage and that nature continued to add on as new ways of gathering information from the environment through light or sound or scdent were invented and new perceptual and emotional motivations assisted with the tasks of living.

## The story of humanity

p61

Ambition, aggression and corruption render societies that appear externally to be flourishing internally rotten.

One of the most important insights to take away from Lucretian prehistory and its reworking is that the purpose of political authority is to reduce interpersonal violence and to make life secure for all. A second insight is that our political and legal systems have been shaped by chance discoveries and new technologies. A third is that while life under civilisation offers a range of marvellous goods and experiences, uncontrolled and concentrated wealth and ambition make exploitation, warfare and corruption inevitable.
Morality and other people
p101

Because the Epicurean believes that all sentient animals do naturally seek pleasure and avoid pain, and because humans are notably clever and conniving, he is realistic about the need for moral conventions to curb and correct what comes naturally. Without explicit moral teaching about how not to treat other people, without the development of the learner’s conscience, people would behave more opportunistically and harmfully than they do. And because retaliation against those who have harmed us is also natural, but leads to never-ending and sometimes bloody feuds, we need institutions that administer punishment fairly and evenly, after taking into consideration the circumstances and effects of the offence and the response to it.

p103

[evolving moral] The Epicurean of today has respect for morality, even while he regards it as needing adjustment to current circumstances and as revisable in the light of experience. And just as the sacrifices of prudence when it comes to long-term planning are not always warranted because they interfere too much with my present enjoyment, a society may decide to allow some harms to some people because the benefits to others are greater.

p104

[why be moral] first, because you understand why, in light of human nature and the multitude of possibilities life offers for harming others, morality is a necessary human invention. Second, because if you believe current moral norms are outdated and based on wrong information, you can work to change them. Third, because you live in a society that cares about morality, you will be punished if you act immorally and are discovered. The last reason, which makes moral conformity prudent, needs some discussion. [meaning social disapproval, verbal criticism, withdrawal of friendship on one hand, and gnawing conscience due to guilt or fear of detection on the other]

Finally , Epicurean morality can be compared with the influential Stoic theory of virtue. The four Stoic virtues were wisdom, temperance, courage and justice.  Epicureans agree to wise, courageous and just actions [...] but she sees wisdom as pleasant and useful rather than moral. [...] and when courage involves inflicting fear, pain and death on other human beings, and putting oneself in the way of pain, fear and death, it is not a quality the Epicurean can admire.

When innocent people, including bystanders, are harmed or killed in police actions, the police are called to account, and the same ought to be true whenever civilians are attacked in the name of international peacekeeping.

## Beware of love!

p113

The most pleasing relationship a man could enter into was, in their view, a non-binding one with a woman whose education was comparable to his own, who was interested in the same ideas that he was and at leisure to discuss them, and who was not concerned with the supposed virtue of chastity.

[on love] The Epicurean does not expect either romance or family life to be plain sailing all the way. Love and passion brian highs and lows, so beware! Don’t blame yourself or the other person too harshly. Don’t be so judgemental about other people’s predicaments. Anguish and uncertainty, the lows as well as the highs, are built into the nature of things.

Epicureans who choose to have children - or who at any rate didn’t avoid having children - strive to make the experience as pleasant as possible for themselves as well as for their children. They introduce them to all the sources of pleasure in life: food and drink, gardens, architecture, music, pictures, travel and knowledge. But both mothers and fathers pursue their investigations of the world and their friendships with persons of their own age. They do not sacrifice adult interests and relationships by overzealously arranging and catering to their children’s social lives and whims.

We have no reason to think that nature has outfitted us with emotions and temperaments that should make our love relations trouble-free as opposed to just good enough for the continuation of the species.

## What is real

Epicureans’ levels of reality
* The eternal, indestructible things: atoms
* The natural composites like animals, moon stars
* The conventional: driving licenses, royalty, clocks, chess games.
* The imaginary: (implicit) believed to belong to nature and explicitly ascribed potent causal powers. According to our best theories, however, they do not exist: ghosts, angels, unicorns, sorcery, phlogiston, lucky numbers. Things that despite not existing by themselves, cause actions due to their existence (people paying mediums, fearing witchcraft or voodoo)
p159

The right to life can be enshrined in law or customary practice as a convention, but it’s up to us to decide in what cases we want to invoke that right and enforce compliance and in what cases we want to deny that it applies. The anti-militarist and the anti-abortion advocate are likely to find themselves on different sides, though both cite the right to life as the pasis for the positions. Such alleged rights as the right to free speech or the right to bear arms are equally conventional rather than natural and accordingly poorly defined. Again, it is up to us to decide how to interpret the right to either one, what specifically to allow in its name, and what specifically to prohibit.

The Epicurean will be alert to the difference between the real causal powers of invisible things [the imaginary] and the actual powerlessness of things whose effects, if any, are really just the effects of her own mind.

## The reality of the past

Human evaluations, as well as human language and experience, are required for there to be facts at all, and this applies to the present as well as to the past. [so] there is no such thing as a unique and full account of a historical event.

For the most part, history textbooks still focus on battles, territory disputes, legislation and treaties. [...] Meanwhile, a great deal is avoided in our curricula [day-do-day life, beliefs, marriage, childrearing, experience of warfare, sickness and labour practices…]

To evaluate political actions only in terms of the success or failure of prominent individuals in achieving their strategic goals, rather than in terms of their effect on human welfare, looks objective, when it is in fact a way of obscuring important truths. Although there are no alternative facts, there are alternative ways of using the facts there are to tell alternative stories.

## What can we know

In general, claims that do not depend on first-hand experience, or on reliable testimony, should not be believed.

Only the sense can correct the senses.

Tempers can run high when people see the world differently and come to believe that they are being victimised because of other people’s supposed misperceptions of reality.

## Religion from an epicurean perspective

p235

We need to be aware of how deeply fear and gratitude are impressed into our psychology and to recognise our dependency on others, while refusing to infer from our experiences that they arise from a supernatural source. All our misfortunes and all our benefits flow from the nature of things. We are assuredly watched and judged by other people and by our own consciences, but not by morally concerned beings who exist outside the ordinary world.

[Is there any point, though, to engaging in religious practices such as praying, singing hymns, reading holy texts, celebrating religious holidays or observing religious restrictions on diet and behaviour? Is there any point to or justification for these activities if you believe the books on which they are based to be human inventions and the divinities to which they refer to be fictitious?
This question can be answered from two perspectives: with regard to personal pains and pleasures, and with regard to morality.

If you enjoy them, there can be no reason not to participate in them except moral reasons:
Moral considerations may move you to join a church or to leave one.

## The meaningful life

p257

The fact of belonging to the human species in the biological sense - being born, growing up, interacting cheerfully with others, loving some of them, producing offspring and dying to make way for the next generation - is a source of meaningfulness. Along with other living things, we participate in cycles of renewal and destruction. Contrary to the common perception of Epicureanism as a philosophy of selfishness and narrow self-interest, it is oriented to the whole of nature, especially - refracted through Lucretiu’s poetry - to living nature. We hand on the ‘torch of life’, as Lucretius calls it, to the next generation. The Epicurean understands that each living individual is part of a system that is ancient and perhaps perpetual. Although the universe may return to its original state - the quantum vacuum - and never emerge from it, many stars and planets will be born, develop, decline and disappear before that happens.

When, like Lucretius in Book VI, you are feeling especially pessimistic about the state of the world, it helps to visit a museum to marvel at what human beings can do when they are not engaged in conquest or wealth-acquisition, but only using their minds, hands and eyes to create objects of beauty. Their vases, pictures and even seemingly humble articles of everyday utility, such as woven baskets and embroidered slippers, can help to restore perspective and a faith in humanity, connecting us with what we can experience as absolute value outside ourselves. In these fabrications, the desire of the artist to excel through the use of his or her own powers and the wish to be useful and give pleasure to others have been fully realised.

## Closing

Epicurean philosophy might be said to be based on the notion of the limit. First, there are natural limits to the lives of animals, people and material objects, to governments and to relationships. We preserve those we value as best we can from an untimely end. Second, there are moral limits that we ought to observe and often fail to: limits on consumption, and on the domination and exploitation of other people and animals. By reconciling ourselves to natural limits and by taking moral limits seriously, we can spare ourselves - and future generations - fear, anxiety and suffering. At the same time, within these natural and moral limits, we can find ample, and often novel and unexpected, enjoyments in the material world and in the companionship of other people.
The inscription at the entrance of Epicuru’s Garden reportedly read: ‘Stranger, here you will do well to tarry; here our highest good is pleasure.’ Defending the authentic Epicurus against those who tried to use him ‘as a screen for their own vices’, the Stoic Seneca advised a young friend as follows: ‘Go to the Garden. The caretaker, a kindly host, will be ready for you; he will welcome you with barley-meal and serve you water also in abundance, with these : “Have you not been well entertained?” “this garde,” he says, “does not whet your appetite: it quenches it.”’
A book can do no more than whet your appetite. But I hope you will tak up the invitation to give Epciureanims a try.
