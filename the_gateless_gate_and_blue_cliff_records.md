concentrate on this word “Mu.” Carry it continuously day and night. Do not form a nihilistic conception of vacancy, or a relative conception of “has” or “has not.”

The following are the essentials. Sit with your back and waist straight. Push the lower part of your belly forward and your buttocks back until your upper body sits comfortably erect. Breathe in normally and exhale in a long, slow, quiet breath. Follow this simple practice until your own method develops from within yourself. Do not be impatient;

The word nen, which has no equivalent in English, means either a unit of thought or a steadily willed activity of mind. Zen theory sees the activity of consciousness as a continuous interplay between a sequence of nen. Thus, the first nen always acts intuitively and performs a direct, pure cognition of the object. The second nen immediately follows the first and makes the first its object of reflection. By this means, one becomes conscious of one’s own thoughts. The successively appearing secondary nen integrate and synthesize preceding nen into a continuous stream of thought. It is these nen which are the basis of self-consciousness and ego-activity. The integrating, synthesizing action of consciousness is the third nen. Reasoning, introspection, and so forth come from the third nen. But this third nen, clouded by its ego-centered activity, often argues falsely and draws mistaken conclusions. This delusive thinking in turn interferes with the pure cognition of the first nen. Zazen practice, when it leads to absolute samadhi, cuts off delusive thoughts. The activity of the second and third nen ceases, and gradually, through constant practice, the first nen is freed to perform its inherently pure and direct cognition. (See the notes to Case 47.) Each nen is accompanied by internal pressure, which remains behind and affects the ensuing thoughts. So causation here represents the effect of each nen-thought on the next. It is not so much the actions of killing, stealing, wronging others, and so on that give rise to evil karma as it is the delusions of the nen-thought, which thinks of killing, stealing, or wronging others. (See the notes to “Mumon’s Zen Warnings” for a discussion of karma.)

“When you were with our teacher Hyakujō, you were clever enough to give ten answers to a single question and hundreds of answers to ten questions. However, sagacity does not help you in studying Zen; in fact it stands in the way of your enlightenment. Now, I am not going to ask you about what you have learned from your reading or from your study of the sutras. Instead, tell me this: What is your real self—the self that existed before you came out of your mother’s womb, before you knew east from west?” At this question Kyōgen was stupefied and did not know what to say. He racked his brains and offered all sorts of answers, but Isan brushed them aside. At last Kyōgen said, “I beg you, please explain it to me.” Isan replied, “What I say belongs to my own understanding. How can that benefit your mind’s eye?” Kyōgen went through all his books and the notes he had made on authorities of every school but could find no words to use as an answer to Isan’s question. Sighing to himself, he said, “You cannot fill an empty stomach with paintings of rice cakes.” He then burned all his books and papers, saying, “I will give up the study of Buddhism in this life. I will remain a rice-gruel monk for the rest of my life and avoid torturing my mind.” Sadly he left Isan, and coming to Nanyang, where the remains of the National Teacher Chū (see Case 17) were buried, he took on the self-appointed job of grave-keeper. In his spirit of dejection he found this humble task best suited to him. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for they are freed from their own deluded egos. One day, when he was sweeping the ground, a stone struck a bamboo. The sound echoed through his mind as the sound of a falling nut rings through the empty valleys and hills at midnight. This was the intuitive first nen ringing through his cleared mind and making a direct, pure cognition of the object. Kyōgen stood speechless, forgetting himself for a while. Then, suddenly bursting into loud laughter, he became enlightened. Enlightenment is consummated when pure cognition is reflected upon by the purified action of the third nen, which is henceforth the master of the mind. Returning to his hut, Kyōgen performed the ceremony of purification, offered incense, paid homage to his teacher, Isan, and with the deepest sense of gratitude said, “Great master, thank you! Your kindness to me is greater even than that of my parents. If you had explained the profound cause to me when I begged you to give me an answer, I should never have reached where I stand today.” Kyōgen’s verse on this occasion runs: One stroke and all is gone, No need of stratagem or cure; Each and every action manifests the ancient Way. My spirit is never downcast, I leave no tracks behind me, Enlightenment is beyond speech, beyond gesture; Those who are emancipated Call it the unsurpassed. •
