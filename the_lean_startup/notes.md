**THE LEAN STARTUP METHOD: Principles**

1. **Entrepreneurs are everywhere .** entrepreneurship includes anyone who works in a human institution designed to create new products and services under conditions of extreme uncertainty. 
2. **Entrepreneurship is management .** A startup is an institution, not just a product, and so it requires a new kind of management specifically geared to its context of extreme uncertainty. 
3. **Validated learning .** Startups exist to learn how to build a sustainable business. This learning can be validated scientifically by running frequent experiments that allow entrepreneurs to test each element of their vision. 
4. **Build-Measure-Learn .** The fundamental activity of a startup is to turn ideas into products, measure how customers respond, and then learn whether to pivot or persevere. All successful startup processes should be geared to accelerate that feedback loop. 
5. **Innovation accounting .**  Hold innovators accountable focusing on the boring stuff: how to measure progress, how to set up milestones, and how to prioritize work. This requires a new kind of accounting designed for startups—and the people who hold them accountable.

## Validated Learning

**Validated learning** is the process of demonstrating empirically that a team has discovered valuable truths about a startup’s present and future business prospects. It is more concrete, more accurate, and faster than market forecasting or classical business planning. It is the principal antidote to the lethal problem of achieving failure: successfully executing a plan that leads nowhere.

Use the **scientific method**, decide a hypothesis and set out to test with a MVP it with users. 

E.g. Hypothesis: People wants to buy shoes online
Test: sell shoes online but doing all the handling manually as MVP (no resources needed almost).

### Mandatory hypotheses to test
* The **value hypothesis** tests whether a product or service really delivers value to customers once they are using it. 
* The **growth hypothesis**, which tests how new customers will discover a product or service, we can do a similar analysis. 

**Example of Kodak questions to evaluate new features**

* Do consumers recognize that they have the problem you are trying to solve?
* If there was a solution, would they buy it?
* Would they buy it from us?
* Can we build a solution for that problem?

**Rule to build a minimum viable product (MVP): remove any feature, process, or effort that does not contribute directly to the learning you seek.**

**Genchi gembutsu**: go and see yourself (japanese saying, meaning you should have direct contact with the users, or use the product yourself, or experience the situation where it might be needed / used).

## Innovation Accounting

**Innovation accounting**, a quantitative approach that allows us to see whether our engine-tuning efforts are bearing fruit (see below types of engine).
It also allows us to create **learning milestones**, which are an alternative to traditional business and product milestones. 
Learning milestones are useful for entrepreneurs as a way of assessing their progress accurately and objectively; they are also invaluable to managers and investors who must hold entrepreneurs accountable.

### How does it work?

1. Use a minimum viable product to **establish a real data baseline** of current situation
2. Attempt to **tune the engine of growth** chosen towards the ideal using
    a. Micro changes
    b. Product optimizations
3. **Pivot or persevere**:
    a. Good progress towards the ideal => learning appropriately and using the knowledge effectively = **persevere**
    b. No progress toward the ideal => product strategy is flawed & needs serious change = **pivot**

### Types of pivots

**Zoom-in Pivot**,
single feature becomes the whole product

**Zoom-out Pivot**, 
single feature is insufficient, it becomes part of larger product

**Customer Segment Pivot**,
company is solving the right problem but offering it to the wrong people. Product hypothesis partially confirmed, there’s a problem worth solving

**Customer Need Pivot**,
 the problem we try to solve is not important, but fine-tuning the engine we find another problem. Product hypothesis partially confirmed, the customers have a problem worth solving

**Platform Pivot**,
change from offering a single application to offering a platform (as vehicle for third parties to create their own products)

**Business Architecture Pivot**,
change from high-margin / low-volume model (**complex systems model**, generally B2B) to low-margin / high-volume (**volume operations model**, generally consumer products) or viceversa.

**Value Capture Pivot**,
change how to monetize the product

**Engine of Growth Pivot**,
change the engine of growth

**Channel Pivot**,
change the way the product is delivered to customers

**Technology Pivot**,
offer the same solution with completely different technology to get superior price and/or performance.

### Metrics: the value of the three A's

* **Actionable**, it must demonstrate clear cause and effect
* **Accessible**, easy to understand, as simple as possible, "metrics are people, too" => try to use tangible concrete units (person visiting website vs. website hit)
* **Auditable**, metrics must be credible to employees, "metrics are people, too" => able to test data by hand in the real world (talking to customers), avoid complex reports to reduce opportunities for error


### New flow for user stories

States:
1. Backlog
2. In development
3. Done (from the point of view)
4. Being validated

Validated defined as "knowing whether the story was a good idea to have been done in the first place". This validation normally would come in the form of a split test showing a change in customer behavior but also might include customer interviews and surveys.

## Where does growth come from 

**Sustainable growth:** new customers come from the actions of past customers.

Types of sustainable growth:

* **Word of mouth**, enthusiast users share the product
* **As a side effect of product usage**: like things that are used / diplayed in public (cars, fashion) or viral products like facebook or paypal (which exposes you to it when someone pays you)
* **Funded advertising**, paying ads to get new customers; ad money needs to come from revenue to be considered sustainable growth
* **Repeat purchase or use**: subscriptions or repeat buys like lightbulbs or groceries

## Engines of growth

Choose an engine of growth as a guide to decide on which metrics to focus on and what really brings value to your company & customers.

### Sticky Engine of Growth

* Products designed to attract and retain customers for the long term.
* Relies on having a high customer retention rate.
* Switching products normally implies huge dissatisfaction
* **Examples**: mobile telephone service provider

#### Metrics: 

**Speed of growth** = rate of compounding = natural growth - churn rate

### Viral Engine of Growth

* Products depend on person-to-person transmission as a necessary consequence of normal use (not due to active evangelists)
* **Example**: hotmail, when you received a mail from them it had a link to claim your free mail account

#### Metrics

**Viral loop** = viral coefficient (# people a customer attracts, needs to be over 1)

### Paid Engine of Growth

* New customers are attracted with paid advertisements
* The amount paid for each new customer is known as cost per acquisition (CPA).
* Customer pays an amount of money for his lifetime as a customer
* Deducing the variable costs from the customer paid amount yields customer lifetime value (LTV). 
* LTV revenue can be invested in acquiring more customers.

#### Metrics

**Marginal Profit = LTV - CPA** (more money per customer than we pay for getting them)


## Plan of new features

**Inverse Build-Measure-Learn** => we figure out what we want to learn and then work backwards to see what product will work as an experiment to get that learning.

Use the smallest batch size that will get the job done.

Thus, it is not the customer, but rather our hypothesis about the customer, that pulls work from product development and other functions. Any other work is a waste.

## The Five Whys

When confronted by a problem, ask why five times. 

Example: 

1. A new release disabled a feature for customers. Why? Because a particular server failed.
2. Why did the server fail? Because an obscure subsystem was used in the wrong way.
3. Why was it used in the wrong way? The engineer who used it didn’t know how to use it properly. 
4. Why didn’t he know? Because he was never trained.
5. Why wasn’t he trained? Because his manager doesn’t believe in training new engineers because he and his team are “too busy.”

Once the issues are identified, work should be assigned to improve each of the five levels of problems.

Make a **proportional investment** at each of the five levels of the hierarchy. In other words, the investment should be smaller when the symptom is minor and larger when the symptom is more painful. (this will lead to **adaptive organizations**)
This should be done in Five Whys meetings

**Cons**: it can devolve into the Five Blames (just juggling responsibilities around). To avoid that:

* Everyone affected by the problem is in the room.
* Seniors should think like this: if a mistake happens, shame on us for making it so easy to make that mistake.

**How to start?**

Needs an environment of mutual trust & empowerment. 

Simpler initial rules:
1. Be tolerant of all mistakes the first time
2. Never allow the same mistake to be made twice.

**Prepare for very unpleasant facts** derived from using this method at the start. Try to appoint someone as referee if disagreements flare up. (aka requires executive leadership to sponsor and support the process).

**Start Small, Be specific**:

* Focus on a very narrowly targeted class of symptoms. Starting too big leads to too much pressure and leads more easily into the Five Blames. Start small to give the team the chance to learn the process. 
* Choose a specific rule of problems to make it easier for everyone to recognize the need of a Five Whys meeting. (e.g. focus on complains related to transaction on credit cards)

**Five Whys master**, individual tasked with deciding prevention steps and assigning follow-up work. Should be senior enough to have authority to ensure the work is done, but not so senior that other responsibilities will prevent him from attending.
