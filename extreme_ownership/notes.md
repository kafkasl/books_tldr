## Part I: Winning the War Within
### Extreme Ownership

#### Principle:
* All responsibility for success and failure rests with the leader.


*The leader must own everything in his or her world*

The leader must acknowledge mistakes and admit failures, take ownership of them, develop a plan to win, and consistenlty work to build a better and more effective team.

When subordinates aren't doing what they should, the leader bears full responsibility [for explaining the strategic mission, developing the tactics, and securing the training and resources to neable the team to properly and successfully execute]

If an individual on the team is not performing at the level required for the team to succeed, the leader must traing and mentor that underperformer.

If underperformers cannot improve, the leader must make the tough call to terminate them

#### Application to business summary:

When people is not doing what you want its your fault always whether because you didn't make your plan clearly understood, a team member is lacking more formation or mentorship, etc... up to the point where it's your fault not to have fired him if he can't improve.

If you're struggling to get feedback from your team about your own performance, you can use this principle to turn everything around. This gives you a framework to improve yourself. You can get constant feedback, because if everyone's mistakes are your fault, you have plenty of feedback and mistakes to learn from in order to prevent them.

### No Bad Teams, Only Bad Leaders
#### Principle:

There are no bad units, only bad leaders.

When it comes to standards, as a leader, **it's not what you preach, it's what you tolerate**.

If substandard performance is accepted and no one is held accountable - if there are no consequences - that poor performance becomes the new standard.

Tasks need to be repeated until the higher expected standard is achieved.

Leaders must push the standards in a way that encourages and enables the team to utilize Extreme Ownership.

Leaders should never be satisfied. They must always strive to improve, and they must build that mind-set into the team. They must face the facts through a realistic, brutally honest assessment of themselves and their team's performance.

**Tortured genius**: is a person who accepts zero responsibility for mistakes, makes excuses, and blames everyone else for their failings (and those of their team). In ther mind, the rest of the world just can't see or appreciate the genius in what they are doing. An individual with a Tortured Genius mind-set can have catastrophic impact on a team's performance.
