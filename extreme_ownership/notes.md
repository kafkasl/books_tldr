## Part I: Winning the War Within
### Extreme Ownership

#### Principle:
* All responsibility for success and failure rests with the leader.


*The leader must own everything in his or her world*

The leader must acknowledge mistakes and admit failures, take ownership of them, develop a plan to win, and consistenlty work to build a better and more effective team.

When subordinates aren't doing what they should, the leader bears full responsibility [for explaining the strategic mission, developing the tactics, and securing the training and resources to neable the team to properly and successfully execute]

If an individual on the team is not performing at the level required for the team to succeed, the leader must traing and mentor that underperformer.

If underperformers cannot improve, the leader must make the tough call to terminate them

#### Application to business summary:

When people is not doing what you want its your fault always whether because you didn't make your plan clearly understood, a team member is lacking more formation or mentorship, etc... up to the point where it's your fault not to have fired him if he can't improve.

If you're struggling to get feedback from your team about your own performance, you can use this principle to turn everything around. This gives you a framework to improve yourself. You can get constant feedback, because if everyone's mistakes are your fault, you have plenty of feedback and mistakes to learn from in order to prevent them.

### No Bad Teams, Only Bad Leaders
#### Principle:

There are no bad units, only bad leaders.

When it comes to standards, as a leader, **it's not what you preach, it's what you tolerate**.

If substandard performance is accepted and no one is held accountable - if there are no consequences - that poor performance becomes the new standard.

Tasks need to be repeated until the higher expected standard is achieved.

Leaders must push the standards in a way that encourages and enables the team to utilize Extreme Ownership.

Leaders should never be satisfied. They must always strive to improve, and they must build that mind-set into the team. They must face the facts through a realistic, brutally honest assessment of themselves and their team's performance.

**Tortured genius**: is a person who accepts zero responsibility for mistakes, makes excuses, and blames everyone else for their failings (and those of their team). In ther mind, the rest of the world just can't see or appreciate the genius in what they are doing. An individual with a Tortured Genius mind-set can have catastrophic impact on a team's performance.

### Believe 

You need to believe in the mission to be effective. Jocko was ordered to include iraqi soldiers in his missions. He was reluctant because they were less trained and skilled and probably would be a liability in missions. When he questioned **why** he had to been ordered to include them, he realized that the overarching goal was to help train them so they could one day defend the country themselves allowing his SEALs and US forces to leave.

#### Principle
A leader must be a *true believer* in the mission.

If he does not believe, he will not take the risks required to overcome the inevitable challenges required to win, nor be able to convince others to do so.

Leaders must always operate with the understanding that they are part of something greater than themselves and their own personal interests.

When leaders receive an order that they question and do not understand, they need to ask **why are we being asked to do this?** Those leaders need to step back, deconstruct the situation, analyze the strategic picture, and come to a conclusion. If they can't get a satisfactory answer they should ask up the chain of command until they understand why.

Senior leaders must take the time to explain and answer questions of their junior leaders so that they too can understand why and believe.

Frontline troops (aka juniors) never have as clear an understanding of the strategic picture as senior leaders might anticipate.

#### Application to business
The CEO devised a new sales compensation plan. It reduced overall compensation to sales people, specially low producers. Mid-level managers didn't understand why so they didn't belive.
They asked *why*. The plan was to reduce costs in sales, thus reducing overhead, and allowing them to lower prices. That would allow their sales people to give better offers and get more compensation. If low performers left, it would also be good as others could pick up their share and get even better.

### Check the Ego

#### Principle 
Ego clouds the mind and disrupts everything: the planning process, the ability to take good advice, and the ability to accept constructive criticisim.

When personal agendas become more important than the team and the overarching mission's success, performance suffers and failure ensues.

Ego can prevent a leader from conducting an honest, realistic assessment of his abilities and his team performance. 

**We must never get complacent**. You can never think you are too good to fail or that your enemies are not capable, deadly and eager to exploit your weaknesses.

#### Application to Business
Someone broke the standard procedure of approving purchases through his manager. The manager must act at is his own fault, and explain to the worker why that procedure is in place. 

E.g.: you are have more experience in this field that I have, but as a manager we set up those standard procedures for a reason. It was my fault for not having explained clearly why these measures are in place and how not following them can cost a lot of money to the company. It is up to me to make sure you know the parameters we have to work within and why some decisions have to been through me.
