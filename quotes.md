"How long ago was it? A decade? Fifteen years? Time was one of those bedrocks of civilisation that didn't have anything sensible to say once you interrogated it.

"And as far as being a leader, you do have a certain potential. But it would be along the lines of a teacher or a minister; you would have to lead from empathy, compassion. You have the desire to impose your ideas on other people, but not your will. Which means, you're right, you'll make one hell of a bad officer unless you shape up." - The Forever War, Joe Haldeman
