# Books too long didn't read


A personal selection of what I enjoyed the most or the most immportant to remember bits of some books I've read. If you are unsure as to whether you'll like a given book, have a long at its tl;dr (too long didn't read) to get a feeling of the book before reading it. Or just get an interesting subset (for me) of its contents.

Also, RIP means Read In Progress in this situation. Not Rest In Peace or Requiescat In Pace (latin version).

Current selection:
