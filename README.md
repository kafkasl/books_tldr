# Too long didn't read: Books


A personal selection of what I enjoyed the most or things I want to remember about books I've read (and mostly a good excuse to practice speed typing). If you are unsure as to whether you'll like a given book, have a look at its tl;dr to get a feeling of the book before reading it. Or just get an interesting subset (for me) of its contents.

Also, RIP means Read In Progress in this situation. Not Rest In Peace or Requiescat In Pace (latin version).

Current selection:
* The pragmatic programmer (RIP)
* Keep Sharp (RIP)
* La felicidad desesperadamente
* How to be an epicurean
